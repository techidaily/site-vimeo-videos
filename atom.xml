In case of Vimeo Plus account, 5GB space is available to users per week and for one year they can access maximum 250GB. If we move towards then Vimeo Pro account then users here will be able to get 20GB &#x2F;week and huge storage space of 1TB for year.</p><h4 id="2-Customization"><a href="#2-Customization" class="headerlink" title="2.

Users can see how many people liked and viewed their videos on channel. If you want to access Vimeo Plus account then pay $59.95&#x2F;year and $9.95&#x2F;month; the feature set is improved with addition of priority support, unlimited channel, albums and groups. Plus account users can avail information about video embed and viewers details. As Vimeo Pro offers so many advanced features like VIO support and advanced stats data so the cost also goes high up to $199&#x2F;year package for 1TB storage space and $399&#x2F;year for 3TB space.</p><h4 id="4-Support"><a href="#4-Support" class="headerlink" title="4.

You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lightworks-3"><a href="#2-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Lightworks"></a>2. Lightworks</h4><p>Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:</p><h4 id="1-Shotcut-3"><a href="#1-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shotcut"></a>1. Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><h4 id="2-Avidemux-3"><a href="#2-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful. It’s simple to use but it can take a while to get used to the layout which could put off someone who is new to editing altogether. You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.</p><p>Detailed Guides to Help You Get Started</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Avidemux to Edit Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop a Video with Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text&#x2F;subtitles with Avidemux? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Filmora-Android-3"><a href="#1-Filmora-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora ( Android"></a>1. Filmora ( Android</h4><p>If you are looking for a video editor for free then the Filmora free version is a great place to start. The software is powerful and has numerous settings to help you to edit your videos to make them look professional giving novices access to edits that would have previously only been available for pro’s who can afford the expensive alternative software. It’s simple to add your videos to edit using a drag and drop function and has support for text, titles, animated text and music. IT also has an array of filters and overlays. Over 100 effects can be incorporated and you can slow down and speed up your videos for added effect. It can be used on both apple and android devices allowing you to edit and upload your videos faster than ever before.</p><h4 id="2-Magisto-iOS-3"><a href="#2-Magisto-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Magisto ( iOS"></a>2. Magisto ( iOS</h4><p>The Magisto free video editor allows you to change any photo or video into a music video that can be shared on social networking sites, email and more. Magisto is aimed at novices to give them a way to create videos that look professional by either turning a few stills into a slideshow to music or altering a video. It’s fun and easy to use, so much so that it has been used in many classroom projects thanks to the automated video production functions. The free version is more of a way to give you a demonstration than being a standalone free editor and you do have to pay the subscription price to be able to access more functions as the production lengths are limited. The automated editing can be off-putting for those looking for the best video editor for Vimeo above a novice level due to the automation, but is perfect for those just finding their feet.</p><h4 id="3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3"><a href="#3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS"></a>3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS</h4><p>One of the best video editor for Vimeo is Quick by GoPro thanks to the fact it has been created to work well for those that want a fast way to edit yet have professionalism in the final cuts. It’s not difficult to set up but it does require 112MB of space and QuickTime to function. For people with a slow connection to the internet or little space on their hard drive this could prove problematic. For new users there is a tutorial to help them find their way around and lots of control over editing including exposure and white balance. There are also numerous pre-set filters to get a professional look whether it’s your first or 1000th time of video editing. Although a great product it does still have a few bugs that need ironing out including the fact that it can crash for seemingly no reason. Aside from this there are numerous functions that would rival quite a few paid editors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Wondershare Filmora"></a>1. Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Wondershare Filmora is great for novices that want to make their videos look professional through editing the finished product. It can be used on both Windows and Mac devices and is simple enough to use for all video makers. There are a number of effects that can be added without being a professional yet creating the effects of one. Whether you want to trim out parts you don’t want in the final edit, add text, captions or more then check out Filmora to see how it can help you to achieve your goals and make you stand out over the millions of other videos on the internet.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Cameo"><a href="#2-Cameo" class="headerlink" title="2. Cameo"></a>2. Cameo</h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo to use on your iPhone or iPad then Cameo is a great choice. It’s free to download and you can pretty much edit anywhere with just your phone and Cameo as your tools. You are able to combine numerous clips from your phones camera roll to enable the editing mode. You can then trim as well as splice with ease. The professionalism comes from the video filters and you can even add themes and soundtracks to suit your video. The only problem with Cameo is that it is only available on iOS devices so android users will have to use an alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-caption-cameo.jpg"                      alt="vimeo"                ></p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Cameo Review-Video Editor &amp; Movie Maker for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Vimeo"></a>Free Video Editor for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="Free-Online-Video-Editor"><a href="#Free-Online-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Free Online Video Editor"></a><strong>Free Online Video Editor</strong></h4><h4 id="1-Kizoa"><a href="#1-Kizoa" class="headerlink" title="1. Kizoa"></a>1. Kizoa</h4><p>The first of the best video editor for Filmora without having to pay is Kizoa. You are able to cut your video clips, add intros and outros with numerous professional pre made effects and even add a soundtrack to your films and picture slideshows. It’s simple to use and cloud based making it ideal for editing anywhere you have access to the internet, however it does only allow for 10 second videos using a free account, 1GB of data and you will need to download a player should you wish to burn the videos onto DVD. If you only wish to find the best video editor for Filmora for short videos then it’s ideal as you can edit, store, share and access a lot of effects to make your clips look professional. For longer videos another editor would be better suited.</p><h4 id="2-Wevideo"><a href="#2-Wevideo" class="headerlink" title="2. Wevideo"></a>2. Wevideo</h4><p>More and more people are using the cloud on the internet from backups to project managing and edits. What can make editors in the cloud difficult to use is the time it can take to upload videos as most people face the upload connections being slower than downloads. With WeVideo you can use cloud based storage which allows for seamless uploading and of course save space on your hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg"                      alt="how to use wevideo"                ></p><p>You can use your mobile devices and PC’s to upload your videos automatically to the cloud. You will then be able to drag them into the editor without delay and best of all, easily. It’s so easy to edit your videos with WeVideo whether you want to trim or add transitions. There are also lots of soundtracks for you to add to your videos and you can even fade the audio in and out for a professional effect. You can even get friends to upload their videos if you wish and add them to your own footage making collaboration easy.</p><p>As a free user you will only be able to export 480p videos and they are watermarked. This is unfortunately not upfront and only shows once you have completed your edit. It is however easy enough to connect to the most popular video services making it easier to share.</p><p>Reas also: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >WeVideo: Easily Create Videos Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-PC"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-PC" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for PC"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for PC</strong></h4><p>On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose. When looking for a free editor be aware than many free versions have limitations which is why we have listed our favourites below.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-Movie-Maker"><a href="#1-Windows-Movie-Maker" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows Movie Maker"></a>1. Windows Movie Maker</h4><p>One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lightworks"><a href="#2-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="2. Lightworks"></a>2. Lightworks</h4><p>Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:</p><h4 id="1-Shotcut"><a href="#1-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="1. Shotcut"></a>1. Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><h4 id="2-Avidemux"><a href="#2-Avidemux" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful. It’s simple to use but it can take a while to get used to the layout which could put off someone who is new to editing altogether. You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.</p><p>Detailed Guides to Help You Get Started</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Avidemux to Edit Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop a Video with Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text&#x2F;subtitles with Avidemux? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Filmora-Android"><a href="#1-Filmora-Android" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora ( Android"></a>1. Filmora ( Android</h4><p>If you are looking for a video editor for free then the Filmora free version is a great place to start.

It’s simple to add your videos to edit using a drag and drop function and has support for text, titles, animated text and music. IT also has an array of filters and overlays. Over 100 effects can be incorporated and you can slow down and speed up your videos for added effect. It can be used on both apple and android devices allowing you to edit and upload your videos faster than ever before.</p><h4 id="2-Magisto-iOS"><a href="#2-Magisto-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Magisto ( iOS"></a>2. Magisto ( iOS</h4><p>The Magisto free video editor allows you to change any photo or video into a music video that can be shared on social networking sites, email and more. Magisto is aimed at novices to give them a way to create videos that look professional by either turning a few stills into a slideshow to music or altering a video. It’s fun and easy to use, so much so that it has been used in many classroom projects thanks to the automated video production functions. The free version is more of a way to give you a demonstration than being a standalone free editor and you do have to pay the subscription price to be able to access more functions as the production lengths are limited. The automated editing can be off-putting for those looking for the best video editor for Vimeo above a novice level due to the automation, but is perfect for those just finding their feet.</p><h4 id="3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS"><a href="#3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS" class="headerlink" title="3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS"></a>3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS</h4><p>One of the best video editor for Vimeo is Quick by GoPro thanks to the fact it has been created to work well for those that want a fast way to edit yet have professionalism in the final cuts. It’s not difficult to set up but it does require 112MB of space and QuickTime to function. For people with a slow connection to the internet or little space on their hard drive this could prove problematic. For new users there is a tutorial to help them find their way around and lots of control over editing including exposure and white balance. There are also numerous pre-set filters to get a professional look whether it’s your first or 1000th time of video editing. Although a great product it does still have a few bugs that need ironing out including the fact that it can crash for seemingly no reason. Aside from this there are numerous functions that would rival quite a few paid editors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-1"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-1" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>In order to create professional videos for Vimeo you will need to start out with at least the basic tools for editing.

It’s simple to use and cloud based making it ideal for editing anywhere you have access to the internet, however it does only allow for 10 second videos using a free account, 1GB of data and you will need to download a player should you wish to burn the videos onto DVD. If you only wish to find the best video editor for Filmora for short videos then it’s ideal as you can edit, store, share and access a lot of effects to make your clips look professional. For longer videos another editor would be better suited.</p><h4 id="2-Wevideo-3"><a href="#2-Wevideo-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Wevideo"></a>2. Wevideo</h4><p>More and more people are using the cloud on the internet from backups to project managing and edits. What can make editors in the cloud difficult to use is the time it can take to upload videos as most people face the upload connections being slower than downloads. With WeVideo you can use cloud based storage which allows for seamless uploading and of course save space on your hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg"                      alt="how to use wevideo"                ></p><p>You can use your mobile devices and PC’s to upload your videos automatically to the cloud. You will then be able to drag them into the editor without delay and best of all, easily. It’s so easy to edit your videos with WeVideo whether you want to trim or add transitions. There are also lots of soundtracks for you to add to your videos and you can even fade the audio in and out for a professional effect. You can even get friends to upload their videos if you wish and add them to your own footage making collaboration easy.</p><p>As a free user you will only be able to export 480p videos and they are watermarked. This is unfortunately not upfront and only shows once you have completed your edit. It is however easy enough to connect to the most popular video services making it easier to share.</p><p>Reas also: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >WeVideo: Easily Create Videos Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-PC-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for PC"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for PC</strong></h4><p>On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose.

Windows Movie Maker"></a>1. Windows Movie Maker</h4><p>One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lightworks-3"><a href="#2-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Lightworks"></a>2. Lightworks</h4><p>Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options.

Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><h4 id="2-Avidemux-3"><a href="#2-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful.

Introduce Vimeo Monetization Options and Explain What It Is</h2><h3 id="Vimeo-what-is-it"><a href="#Vimeo-what-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Vimeo - what is it?"></a>Vimeo - what is it?</h3><p>In 2004, Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein created Vimeo, an American video platform. At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand" class="headerlink" title="1.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year.

The article below includes details about all popular Video flavours that beginners as well as professionals will love to explore.</p><p> Here’s our<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full Review of Vimeo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Datiled-Comparison"><a href="#Datiled-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Datiled Comparison"></a>Datiled Comparison</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-accounts-comparison.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-accounts-comparison"                ></p><h4 id="1-Storage"><a href="#1-Storage" class="headerlink" title="1. Storage"></a>1. Storage</h4><p> If we talk about storage space then Vimeo Basic account offers maximum upload of only 500MB&#x2F; per or in other words, you can access 25GB for one year. In case of Vimeo Plus account, 5GB space is available to users per week and for one year they can access maximum 250GB. If we move towards then Vimeo Pro account then users here will be able to get 20GB &#x2F;week and huge storage space of 1TB for year.</p><h4 id="2-Customization"><a href="#2-Customization" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization"></a>2. Customization</h4><p> The Vimeo basic free version cannot assist users with video customization features but outro and video player can be customized in case of Vimeo Plus account. Further, Vimeo Pro account assist users in advanced personalization features like facility to add logos, create customized outro etc. It also offers third party support for players.</p><h4 id="3-Pricacy-and-Stats"><a href="#3-Pricacy-and-Stats" class="headerlink" title="3. Pricacy and Stats"></a>3. Pricacy and Stats</h4><p> The Basic account can be accessed for free but it still offers so many incredible features like no duration limit, no advertisements, Video password protection as well as basic video conversion features. Users can see how many people liked and viewed their videos on channel. If you want to access Vimeo Plus account then pay $59.95&#x2F;year and $9.95&#x2F;month; the feature set is improved with addition of priority support, unlimited channel, albums and groups. Plus account users can avail information about video embed and viewers details. As Vimeo Pro offers so many advanced features like VIO support and advanced stats data so the cost also goes high up to $199&#x2F;year package for 1TB storage space and $399&#x2F;year for 3TB space.</p><h4 id="4-Support"><a href="#4-Support" class="headerlink" title="4.

The Vimeo Plus account users can avail response from support team within 4 hours during business days. The best thing to know about highly advanced Vimeo pro account users is that users can get answers for their queries within one hour and it stays active 24 hours even on weekends.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that basic membership option is great option for beginners but in case if you are in search of priority support service, privacy control, huge storage space, player customization and few other advanced tools then Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro will be more suitable to you. Price range also matters so prefer to pick your software tool as per your budget and needs to have best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-1"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-1" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Market is loaded with the software that can assist users in video hosting needs.

There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:</p><h4 id="1-Shotcut-3"><a href="#1-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shotcut"></a>1. Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><h4 id="2-Avidemux-3"><a href="#2-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful. It’s simple to use but it can take a while to get used to the layout which could put off someone who is new to editing altogether. You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.</p><p>Detailed Guides to Help You Get Started</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Avidemux to Edit Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop a Video with Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text&#x2F;subtitles with Avidemux? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Filmora-Android-3"><a href="#1-Filmora-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora ( Android"></a>1. Filmora ( Android</h4><p>If you are looking for a video editor for free then the Filmora free version is a great place to start. The software is powerful and has numerous settings to help you to edit your videos to make them look professional giving novices access to edits that would have previously only been available for pro’s who can afford the expensive alternative software. It’s simple to add your videos to edit using a drag and drop function and has support for text, titles, animated text and music. IT also has an array of filters and overlays. Over 100 effects can be incorporated and you can slow down and speed up your videos for added effect. It can be used on both apple and android devices allowing you to edit and upload your videos faster than ever before.</p><h4 id="2-Magisto-iOS-3"><a href="#2-Magisto-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Magisto ( iOS"></a>2. Magisto ( iOS</h4><p>The Magisto free video editor allows you to change any photo or video into a music video that can be shared on social networking sites, email and more. Magisto is aimed at novices to give them a way to create videos that look professional by either turning a few stills into a slideshow to music or altering a video. It’s fun and easy to use, so much so that it has been used in many classroom projects thanks to the automated video production functions. The free version is more of a way to give you a demonstration than being a standalone free editor and you do have to pay the subscription price to be able to access more functions as the production lengths are limited. The automated editing can be off-putting for those looking for the best video editor for Vimeo above a novice level due to the automation, but is perfect for those just finding their feet.</p><h4 id="3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3"><a href="#3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS"></a>3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS</h4><p>One of the best video editor for Vimeo is Quick by GoPro thanks to the fact it has been created to work well for those that want a fast way to edit yet have professionalism in the final cuts. It’s not difficult to set up but it does require 112MB of space and QuickTime to function. For people with a slow connection to the internet or little space on their hard drive this could prove problematic. For new users there is a tutorial to help them find their way around and lots of control over editing including exposure and white balance. There are also numerous pre-set filters to get a professional look whether it’s your first or 1000th time of video editing. Although a great product it does still have a few bugs that need ironing out including the fact that it can crash for seemingly no reason. Aside from this there are numerous functions that would rival quite a few paid editors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-effortless-online-video-access-via-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Effortless Online Video Access via Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-free-and-paid-tools-for-vimeo-video-downloads/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Free & Paid Tools for Vimeo Video Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-break-free-10-innovative-editors-beyond-vimeos-boundaries/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Break Free  10 Innovative Editors Beyond Vimeo's Boundaries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-vimeo-video-editing-top-5-techniques-for-cuts-and-trimming/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Vimeo Video Editing  Top 5 Techniques for Cuts & Trimming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-the-speed-of-vimeo-videos/"><u>[New] Enhancing the Speed of Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-bring-your-creative-windows-video-projects-online-via-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Bring Your Creative Windows Video Projects Online via Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-vimeo-video-editing-top-5-techniques-for-cuts-and-trimming/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Vimeo Video Editing  Top 5 Techniques for Cuts & Trimming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/elevating-your-vimeo-presence-with-imovie-videos/"><u>Elevating Your Vimeo Presence with iMovie Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tips-for-faster-vimeo-video-viewing/"><u>2024 Approved  Tips for Faster Vimeo Video Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-free-power-learn-to-edit-videos-on-vimeo-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlock FREE Power  Learn to Edit Videos on Vimeo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-digital-moguls-guide-to-vimeo-earnings-mastery/"><u>[New] The Digital Mogul's Guide to Vimeo Earnings Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-what-makes-vimeo-special-a-look-inside/"><u>[New] What Makes Vimeo Special?

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control.

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-non-vimeo-powerhouses-for-video-content-creation/"><u>2024 Approved  Non-Vimeo Powerhouses for Video Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-rev-up-your-earnings-a-deep-dive-into-vimeo-profits/"><u>2024 Approved  Rev Up Your Earnings  A Deep Dive Into Vimeo Profits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-scalable-techniques-for-vimeo-broadcasting/"><u>[Updated] Scalable Techniques for Vimeo Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlock-content-potential-with-the-right-vimeo-membership-choice-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlock Content Potential with the Right Vimeo Membership Choice for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/shape-your-story-5-proven-techniques-for-cutting-and-condensing-vimeo-videos-online-for-2024/"><u>Shape Your Story  5 Proven Techniques for Cutting & Condensing Vimeo Videos Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-strategies-to-optimize-time-and-quality-in-thumbnail-design/"><u>[New] Strategies to Optimize Time and Quality in Thumbnail Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-essential-tips-for-extracting-vimeo-content-as-high-quality-mp4s/"><u>[New] Essential Tips for Extracting Vimeo Content as High-Quality MP4s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-viewers-to-valuables-mastering-video-monetization-on-vimeo/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  From Viewers to Valuables  Mastering Video Monetization on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-step-by-step-process-for-high-quality-thumbnails/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Step-by-Step Process for High-Quality Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tutorial-extracting-audio-from-vimeo-video/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Tutorial  Extracting Audio From Vimeo Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-propagate-your-content-with-vimeo-links/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Propagate Your Content with Vimeo Links</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/find-your-fit-understanding-basic-to-pro-plans-at-vimeo/"><u>Find Your Fit  Understanding Basic to Pro Plans at Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-chrome-add-ons-boosted-vimeo-video-downloads/"><u>In 2024, Top Chrome Add-Ons  Boosted Vimeo Video Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-conquer-youtube-vimeo-editing-5-advanced-trimming-strategies/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Conquer YouTube-Vimeo Editing  5 Advanced Trimming Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-process-of-embedding-vimeo-media-in-ppts/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating the Process of Embedding Vimeo Media in PPTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-expert-tips-add-ons-that-elevate-your-vimeo-video-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expert Tips  Add-Ons that Elevate Your Vimeo Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-which-ios-app-crushes-in-video-editing-cameo-or-filmorago/"><u>[Updated] Which iOS App Crushes in Video Editing?
