But due to Vimeo speed control limitations, opting for other Vimeo playback speed increase is not an option.

There are two approaches to this method even though they are almost similar. Are you the owner of the videos and do you want to speed up video playback when watching the video on Vimeo?</p><p>Vimeo offers its users the latitude to watch videos at six different speeds as illustrated below.</p><ul><li>5X - 0.5 times slower than the normal speed</li><li>75X - 0.75 times slower than the normal speed</li><li>Normal speed</li><li>25X - 1.25 times faster than the normal speed</li><li>5X - 1.5 times faster than the normal speed</li><li>2X - 2 times faster than the normal speed</li></ul><p>Here are the steps:</p><p>Step 1: Launch Vimeo on your desktop and select video</p><p> After launching Vimeo, click on the <strong>Video</strong> button located on the left side. From your video list, select the video you want to watch and click to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-video-manager-videos-option.jpg"                      alt="vimeo video manager videos option"                ></p><p>Step 2: Open the speed control feature and select speed</p><p>While watching your video, click the <strong>Gear</strong> icon at the bottom right. On the speed control option, click on the downward arrow and choose either the 1.2X, 1.5X or 2X to watch the videos at an increased speed.</p><p>Click the play icon and continue enjoying your video at an increased speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-vimeo-video-playback-speed.jpg"                      alt="change vimeo video playback speed"                ></p><p>Suppose you want to speed up a Vimeo video while watching from the Comedy section!

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes.

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-stream-to-file-vimeo-hd-to-mp4-methods/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Stream to File Vimeo HD to MP4 Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-premier-6-modern-architecture-in-mc-world/"><u>[New] In 2024, Premier 6 Modern Architecture in MC World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-a-step-by-step-to-adding-music-to-vimeo-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Step-by-Step to Adding Music to Vimeo Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-visionaries-in-video-top-10-ig-editing-platforms-for-creatives/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Visionaries in Video Top 10 IG Editing Platforms for Creatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/build-your-own-chrome-paleontology-adventure-google-unveils-a-lego-style-dinosaur-browser-experience/"><u>Build Your Own Chrome Paleontology Adventure – Google Unveils a LEGO-Style Dinosaur Browser Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/fast-tracking-your-vimeo-watch-time-for-2024/"><u>Fast-Tracking Your Vimeo Watch Time for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-successfully-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-from-apple-iphone-6s-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Successfully Bypass iCloud Activation Lock from Apple iPhone 6s Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-13-pro-max-with-imei-code-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 13 Pro Max with IMEI Code?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-from-vivo-y28-5g-to-iphone-contacts-transfer-apps-and-software-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 from Vivo Y28 5G to iPhone Contacts Transfer Apps and Software | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-unseen-horizons-hot-list-of-vr-peripherals-top-10/"><u>In 2024, Unseen Horizons Hot List of VR Peripherals (Top 10)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-motorola-defy-2-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Motorola Defy 2 Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control.

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control.

While this approach may be slower and demand better command of filmmaking principles, it is still simple and convenient enough to allow almost anyone to put together a video using a combination of existing clips and photos, or new recordings you make in real-time with your phone or web camera.</p><ol><li><strong>Start from Scratch and upload media</strong></li></ol><p>Click the Start from Scratch button on the Vimeo Create the main interface, and then create a Storyboard. In this section, you can select and upload the media you want to use, with a wide variety of formats supported including (JPG, JPEg, GIF, PNG, AVI, MP4, MPG, and many more).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-vimeo-storyboard.jpg"                      alt="Vimeo Create Storyboard"                ></p><p>Media can be imported from various sources, including your device, your Google Photos account, Vimeo Library, or external web repositories of stock photos and videos. For users with the Business or Premium account, there are additional business-related tools available within the Brand Kit. In this section, you can upload custom logs, or chose specific color palettes. You can also set up the duration of your video as well as screen orientation, although you can also leave this to be defined automatically.</p><p>Reorder the uploaded images and video footage, add text in the uploaded media accordingly, and then click Next to continue.</p><ol><li><strong>Choose a style</strong></li></ol><p>Next, you need to open the Style section and take care of some aesthetic elements of your videos, including overlay graphics and transitions between shots. There are many styles to choose from, but you need to carefully check which one matches your idea the best.</p><p>That’s why the preview screen is so indispensable, as it allows you to test various possibilities and find one that really pushes your video to the next level.</p><ol><li><strong>Add music</strong></li></ol><p>After you polish the video in a visual sense, you should turn your attention to the audio. Music can add another layer to the story and make the video more appealing to the audience, but you need to be aware of certain limitations imposed by Vimeo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-video-create-add-music.jpg"                      alt="Vimeo Create add music"                ></p><p>You can use audio content from Vimeo’s own library, but if you upload your own music you won’t be able to share the video on Vimeo, even if you own a license. This is something to take into account based on the intended application of your video, so you can decide which approach to sound is the most appropriate.</p><p>Want to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add your own music to the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and share it online?

You can save the draft in the Video Manager section, and then preview it as many times as needed to see areas that have yet to be corrected.</p><p>This stage of the process is very important, as you don’t want a technical glitch to spoil the impression. Go back and change any element of your video, then save a new version and preview it again. When you reach the point that you are completely happy with the outcome, just click on the <strong>Save and share</strong> button and your video will have an instant debut on the internet.</p><p>Still, this is not necessarily the end of the process – you can continue editing your video with Vimeo Video Maker even after it’s been uploaded. Just tap the Edit button to restart the editing procedure once again and fix any issues you spotted.</p><p><strong>FAQs About Create and Edit Videos on Vimeo</strong></p><ol><li><strong>What is Vimeo Create?</strong></li></ol><p>Vimeo Create is a new video maker tool from Vimeo, which allows you to create a social video or a business video with templates, stock photos, videos, etc. Vimeo has released the mobile Vimeo Create app for Android and iOS platforms, you can get it on <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vimeocreate.videoeditor.moviemaker&hl=en&gl=US" >Google Play <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vimeo-create-video-editor/id1491791513" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly.

There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lightworks"><a href="#2-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="2.

Cameo"></a>2. Cameo</h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo to use on your iPhone or iPad then Cameo is a great choice.

You are able to combine numerous clips from your phones camera roll to enable the editing mode. You can then trim as well as splice with ease. The professionalism comes from the video filters and you can even add themes and soundtracks to suit your video. The only problem with Cameo is that it is only available on iOS devices so android users will have to use an alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-caption-cameo.jpg"                      alt="vimeo"                ></p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Cameo Review-Video Editor &amp; Movie Maker for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Vimeo"></a>Free Video Editor for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="Free-Online-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Free-Online-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Online Video Editor"></a><strong>Free Online Video Editor</strong></h4><h4 id="1-Kizoa-3"><a href="#1-Kizoa-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Kizoa"></a>1. Kizoa</h4><p>The first of the best video editor for Filmora without having to pay is Kizoa. You are able to cut your video clips, add intros and outros with numerous professional pre made effects and even add a soundtrack to your films and picture slideshows. It’s simple to use and cloud based making it ideal for editing anywhere you have access to the internet, however it does only allow for 10 second videos using a free account, 1GB of data and you will need to download a player should you wish to burn the videos onto DVD. If you only wish to find the best video editor for Filmora for short videos then it’s ideal as you can edit, store, share and access a lot of effects to make your clips look professional. For longer videos another editor would be better suited.</p><h4 id="2-Wevideo-3"><a href="#2-Wevideo-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Wevideo"></a>2. Wevideo</h4><p>More and more people are using the cloud on the internet from backups to project managing and edits. What can make editors in the cloud difficult to use is the time it can take to upload videos as most people face the upload connections being slower than downloads. With WeVideo you can use cloud based storage which allows for seamless uploading and of course save space on your hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg"                      alt="how to use wevideo"                ></p><p>You can use your mobile devices and PC’s to upload your videos automatically to the cloud. You will then be able to drag them into the editor without delay and best of all, easily. It’s so easy to edit your videos with WeVideo whether you want to trim or add transitions. There are also lots of soundtracks for you to add to your videos and you can even fade the audio in and out for a professional effect. You can even get friends to upload their videos if you wish and add them to your own footage making collaboration easy.</p><p>As a free user you will only be able to export 480p videos and they are watermarked. This is unfortunately not upfront and only shows once you have completed your edit. It is however easy enough to connect to the most popular video services making it easier to share.</p><p>Reas also: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >WeVideo: Easily Create Videos Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-PC-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for PC"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for PC</strong></h4><p>On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose. When looking for a free editor be aware than many free versions have limitations which is why we have listed our favourites below.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-Movie-Maker-3"><a href="#1-Windows-Movie-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows Movie Maker"></a>1. Windows Movie Maker</h4><p>One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Lightworks-3"><a href="#2-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Lightworks"></a>2. Lightworks</h4><p>Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:</p><h4 id="1-Shotcut-3"><a href="#1-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shotcut"></a>1. Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><h4 id="2-Avidemux-3"><a href="#2-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful. It’s simple to use but it can take a while to get used to the layout which could put off someone who is new to editing altogether. You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.</p><p>Detailed Guides to Help You Get Started</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Avidemux to Edit Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop a Video with Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text&#x2F;subtitles with Avidemux? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Filmora-Android-3"><a href="#1-Filmora-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="1.
