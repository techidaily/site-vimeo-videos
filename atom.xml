For longer videos another editor would be better suited.</p><h4 id="2-Wevideo"><a href="#2-Wevideo" class="headerlink" title="2. Wevideo"></a>2. Wevideo</h4><p>More and more people are using the cloud on the internet from backups to project managing and edits.

You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044582/7443" target="_top" id="2044582">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044582" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044582/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Lightworks"><a href="#2-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="2.

Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks.

It’s free to download and you can pretty much edit anywhere with just your phone and Cameo as your tools. You are able to combine numerous clips from your phones camera roll to enable the editing mode. You can then trim as well as splice with ease. The professionalism comes from the video filters and you can even add themes and soundtracks to suit your video. The only problem with Cameo is that it is only available on iOS devices so android users will have to use an alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-caption-cameo.jpg"                      alt="vimeo"                ></p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Cameo Review-Video Editor &amp; Movie Maker for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Vimeo"></a>Free Video Editor for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="Free-Online-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Free-Online-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Online Video Editor"></a><strong>Free Online Video Editor</strong></h4><h4 id="1-Kizoa-3"><a href="#1-Kizoa-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

You are able to cut your video clips, add intros and outros with numerous professional pre made effects and even add a soundtrack to your films and picture slideshows. It’s simple to use and cloud based making it ideal for editing anywhere you have access to the internet, however it does only allow for 10 second videos using a free account, 1GB of data and you will need to download a player should you wish to burn the videos onto DVD. If you only wish to find the best video editor for Filmora for short videos then it’s ideal as you can edit, store, share and access a lot of effects to make your clips look professional. For longer videos another editor would be better suited.</p><h4 id="2-Wevideo-3"><a href="#2-Wevideo-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Wevideo"></a>2. Wevideo</h4><p>More and more people are using the cloud on the internet from backups to project managing and edits. What can make editors in the cloud difficult to use is the time it can take to upload videos as most people face the upload connections being slower than downloads. With WeVideo you can use cloud based storage which allows for seamless uploading and of course save space on your hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg"                      alt="how to use wevideo"                ></p><p>You can use your mobile devices and PC’s to upload your videos automatically to the cloud. You will then be able to drag them into the editor without delay and best of all, easily. It’s so easy to edit your videos with WeVideo whether you want to trim or add transitions. There are also lots of soundtracks for you to add to your videos and you can even fade the audio in and out for a professional effect. You can even get friends to upload their videos if you wish and add them to your own footage making collaboration easy.</p><p>As a free user you will only be able to export 480p videos and they are watermarked. This is unfortunately not upfront and only shows once you have completed your edit. It is however easy enough to connect to the most popular video services making it easier to share.</p><p>Reas also: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >WeVideo: Easily Create Videos Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-PC-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for PC"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for PC</strong></h4><p>On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose. When looking for a free editor be aware than many free versions have limitations which is why we have listed our favourites below.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-Movie-Maker-3"><a href="#1-Windows-Movie-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows Movie Maker"></a>1. Windows Movie Maker</h4><p>One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lightworks-3"><a href="#2-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Lightworks"></a>2. Lightworks</h4><p>Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002018/7443" target="_top" id="2002018">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002018" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002018/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:</p><h4 id="1-Shotcut-3"><a href="#1-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shotcut"></a>1. Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><h4 id="2-Avidemux-3"><a href="#2-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful.

You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.</p><p>Detailed Guides to Help You Get Started</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Avidemux to Edit Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop a Video with Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text&#x2F;subtitles with Avidemux? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087234/19272" target="_top" id="2087234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087234/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Filmora-Android-3"><a href="#1-Filmora-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Magisto is aimed at novices to give them a way to create videos that look professional by either turning a few stills into a slideshow to music or altering a video. It’s fun and easy to use, so much so that it has been used in many classroom projects thanks to the automated video production functions. The free version is more of a way to give you a demonstration than being a standalone free editor and you do have to pay the subscription price to be able to access more functions as the production lengths are limited. The automated editing can be off-putting for those looking for the best video editor for Vimeo above a novice level due to the automation, but is perfect for those just finding their feet.</p><h4 id="3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3"><a href="#3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.</p><p><strong><em>Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?</em></strong></p><p>One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.</p><p> <strong><em>Why can’t I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?</em></strong></p><p>If you’re a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos. Only the Vimeo Pro, Premium, Business, and Enterprise members can add the chapters to video. Moreover, make sure you’re adding less than 100 chapters per video with a title of fewer than 50 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Saving your audience’s time with unique features, including the chapters, call-to-action screens, and end screens, is getting common these days on Vimeo!

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes.

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-climbing-the-popularity-ladder-with-staff-chosen-videos-at-vimeo/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Climbing the Popularity Ladder with Staff-Chosen Videos at Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-digital-savvy-guide-opting-between-software-and-no-software-for-vimeo/"><u>[New] In 2024, Digital Savvy Guide Opting Between Software & No-Software for Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-harmonizing-hearts-and-hertz-music-on-the-vimeo-scene/"><u>[New] In 2024, Harmonizing Hearts and Hertz Music on the Vimeo Scene</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximizing-vimeo-video-watch-time/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximizing Vimeo Video Watch Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-effortless-video-creation-learn-basic-edits-on-vimeo-for-free-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Effortless Video Creation Learn Basic Edits on Vimeo for Free for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-audio-experience-on-your-iphone-device-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhance Audio Experience on Your iPhone Device for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-interactive-solutions-with-vr/"><u>[Updated] Interactive Solutions with VR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-filming-techniques-on-tiktok-platforms/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Filming Techniques on TikTok Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-best-practices-in-downloading-vimeo-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Unveiling the Best Practices in Downloading Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/demystify-video-editing-with-free-vimeo-resources-for-2024/"><u>Demystify Video Editing with Free Vimeo Resources for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-a-locked-nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Enable USB Debugging on a Locked Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/how-to-update-or-fresh-install-windows-7-audio-device-drivers/"><u>How to Update or Fresh Install Windows 7 Audio Device Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-composition-and-tints-mastering-color-usage/"><u>In 2024, Composition and Tints Mastering Color Usage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhancing-digital-presence-with-vimeo-sharing/"><u>In 2024, Enhancing Digital Presence with Vimeo Sharing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-motorola-defy-2-adb-format-tool-for-pc-vs-other-unlocking-tools-which-one-is-the-best-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Motorola Defy 2 ADB Format Tool for PC vs. Other Unlocking Tools Which One is the Best?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-reel-of-excellence-ice-artistry-in-22-summary/"><u>In 2024, Reel of Excellence - Ice Artistry in '22 Summary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/mastering-instagram-live-a-guide-to-staying-incognito-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Instagram Live A Guide to Staying Incognito for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/the-science-of-luts-elevating-photo-aesthetics-for-2024/"><u>The Science of LUTs Elevating Photo Aesthetics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-4-sim-location-trackers-to-easily-find-your-lost-honor-magic-6-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 4 SIM Location Trackers To Easily Find Your Lost Honor Magic 6 Device</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

An honest answer is, there is no simple way to obtain such clips from the streaming platform. And it’s not only the case with Vimeo, but even YouTube and many other similar platforms wouldn’t allow you to download videos that don’t belong to you from their servers due to copyright restrictions.</p><p>If you have seen the Download button under the video player, then you can click it to download the Vimeo video directly.

In this section, you can select and upload the media you want to use, with a wide variety of formats supported including (JPG, JPEg, GIF, PNG, AVI, MP4, MPG, and many more).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-vimeo-storyboard.jpg"                      alt="Vimeo Create Storyboard"                ></p><p>Media can be imported from various sources, including your device, your Google Photos account, Vimeo Library, or external web repositories of stock photos and videos. For users with the Business or Premium account, there are additional business-related tools available within the Brand Kit. In this section, you can upload custom logs, or chose specific color palettes. You can also set up the duration of your video as well as screen orientation, although you can also leave this to be defined automatically.</p><p>Reorder the uploaded images and video footage, add text in the uploaded media accordingly, and then click Next to continue.</p><ol><li><strong>Choose a style</strong></li></ol><p>Next, you need to open the Style section and take care of some aesthetic elements of your videos, including overlay graphics and transitions between shots. There are many styles to choose from, but you need to carefully check which one matches your idea the best.</p><p>That’s why the preview screen is so indispensable, as it allows you to test various possibilities and find one that really pushes your video to the next level.</p><ol><li><strong>Add music</strong></li></ol><p>After you polish the video in a visual sense, you should turn your attention to the audio. Music can add another layer to the story and make the video more appealing to the audience, but you need to be aware of certain limitations imposed by Vimeo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-video-create-add-music.jpg"                      alt="Vimeo Create add music"                ></p><p>You can use audio content from Vimeo’s own library, but if you upload your own music you won’t be able to share the video on Vimeo, even if you own a license. This is something to take into account based on the intended application of your video, so you can decide which approach to sound is the most appropriate.</p><p>Want to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add your own music to the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and share it online?

You can save the draft in the Video Manager section, and then preview it as many times as needed to see areas that have yet to be corrected.</p><p>This stage of the process is very important, as you don’t want a technical glitch to spoil the impression. Go back and change any element of your video, then save a new version and preview it again. When you reach the point that you are completely happy with the outcome, just click on the <strong>Save and share</strong> button and your video will have an instant debut on the internet.</p><p>Still, this is not necessarily the end of the process – you can continue editing your video with Vimeo Video Maker even after it’s been uploaded. Just tap the Edit button to restart the editing procedure once again and fix any issues you spotted.</p><p><strong>FAQs About Create and Edit Videos on Vimeo</strong></p><ol><li><strong>What is Vimeo Create?</strong></li></ol><p>Vimeo Create is a new video maker tool from Vimeo, which allows you to create a social video or a business video with templates, stock photos, videos, etc. Vimeo has released the mobile Vimeo Create app for Android and iOS platforms, you can get it on <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vimeocreate.videoeditor.moviemaker&hl=en&gl=US" >Google Play <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vimeo-create-video-editor/id1491791513" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly.

The Vimeo extension allows sharing the video only with people you choose.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Vimeo-Video-Screens-on-Mobile-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Vimeo-Video-Screens-on-Mobile-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record Vimeo Video Screens on Mobile?"></a>Part 2: How to Record Vimeo Video Screens on Mobile?</h2><p>As we said before, the Vimeo Record tool is currently available as a Chrome extension, and there is no app of Vimeo Record for iPhone or Android devices. But if you want to record the Vimeo video screen on mobile, you can do that.</p><p>Android devices, including Android 10, offer <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >built-in screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here is how to capture the content of your Android mobile screen:</p><p>In the Quick Settings menu, launch Screen Recording. Of course, depending on the purpose of your video, you can allow access to mic only, camera only, or both. At the beginning of the process, you will see a short countdown - 3, 2, 1, and the recording starts. Piece of cake!</p><p>After you are done performing all the actions on your phone that you want to share on Vimeo, just stop recording and your video will be saved automatically in the cloud. You can download videos to your phone or share them instantly through one or more social media platforms. It’s not hard to stay in touch with all the recordings and get notifications whenever someone views the video and comments. Using this approach for business will put you in a better position in the market and stimulate engagement with the customers.</p><p>If you are using the iOS devices, you can record the Vimeo video screen with the in-built screen recorder feature if your iPhone is running iOS 11 and later versions.

This software suite is packed with professional-level options and stunning visual effects, allowing you to do far more than simply capture the screen. Among other things, you can precisely define which section of the screen to record, eliminate camera shake effect or noise, add music to the background, and improve the quality of your videos in many creative ways.</p><p>In other words, using Filmora to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record your screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and webcam gives you additional options to express yourself and fulfill your business objectives while saving time for you and your team.

In addition, you have to make sure that external microphone is selected in the audio menu if you want to narrate your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-3.jpg"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Screen Record Options"                ></p><p>Furthermore, ticking the <strong>Record the Camera Stream</strong> checkbox at the bottom of the window will enable you to capture the screen and webcam feed simultaneously. When ready, you should click on the Red Record button to initiate the screen recording session.</p><p>Filmora X lets you pause the recording whenever you want, while you can also use the Record Timer box to limit the duration of the session. After you’ve recorded the footage, you can use the video editor’s tools to polish the footage before exporting it or uploading it to your Vimeo account.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora  Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora   Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Quick Fix: Why I Can’t Use Vimeo Recorder on My Mac Computer?</strong></p><p>After installing the Vimeo screen recorder, Mac users sometimes need to perform a few preparatory steps to allow the extension to launch. Open System Preferences, and click the Security &amp; Privacy icon. Scroll to Screen Recording, and allow Google Chrome access to the content of the screen.</p><p>Of course, at this point, you’ll also have to grant permission to access your camera and microphone. Once you activate all the necessary options, restart Chrome and full range of screen capturing tools will be at your disposal.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Possibilities for personal and professional communication are almost unlimited once you master the advanced features of the Vimeo screen recorder of your choice. Regardless of your choice of software tools, it’s very easy to produce high-end educational materials and how-to-do videos, or simply share your current thoughts with online friends.</p><p>However, if you have an ambitious project, built-in screen recording tools may not be sufficiently advanced. Using the Wondershare Filmora X to record and edit Vimeo clips based on the feed from your screen and webcam is a better option, especially for users who understand how to effectively use the finer video-making features of this incredible software. You can even record your mobile screen and create videos nearly instantly, so your creativity is virtually unbound when you have the right tools in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-explore-the-difference-basic-plus-and-pro-in-vimeo-services-for-2024/"><u>[New] Explore The Difference Basic, Plus & Pro in Vimeo Services for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-spin-into-popularity-the-art-of-video-reversal-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[New] Spin Into Popularity The Art of Video Reversal on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-quick-guide-extract-vimeo-videos-as-mp4s/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Quick Guide Extract Vimeo Videos as MP4s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-delving-into-vimeo-your-ultimate-video-partner-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Delving Into Vimeo Your Ultimate Video Partner for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-from-periscope-to-pro-livestreaming-basics-for-ios-and-android/"><u>[Updated] From Periscope to Pro Livestreaming Basics for iOS and Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-guide-to-structuring-youtube-content-with-separate-chapters/"><u>2024 Approved Guide to Structuring YouTube Content with Separate Chapters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-precision-editing-made-easy-top-5-techniques-for-trimming-and-cutting-vimeo-footage/"><u>2024 Approved Precision Editing Made Easy Top 5 Techniques for Trimming & Cutting Vimeo Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/advanced-methods-save-vimeo-content/"><u>Advanced Methods Save Vimeo Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/boosting-vimeo-content-delivery-for-2024/"><u>Boosting Vimeo Content Delivery for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/can-i-bypass-a-forgotten-phone-password-of-infinix-zero-30-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>Can I Bypass a Forgotten Phone Password Of Infinix Zero 30 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-from-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-to-samsung-simplified-guide-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Transfer From Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Samsung Simplified Guide | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-looking-for-a-location-changer-on-lava-blaze-curve-5g-look-no-further-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Looking For A Location Changer On Lava Blaze Curve 5G?

You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.</p><p><strong><em>Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?</em></strong></p><p>One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.</p><p> <strong><em>Why can’t I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?</em></strong></p><p>If you’re a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos. Only the Vimeo Pro, Premium, Business, and Enterprise members can add the chapters to video. Moreover, make sure you’re adding less than 100 chapters per video with a title of fewer than 50 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Saving your audience’s time with unique features, including the chapters, call-to-action screens, and end screens, is getting common these days on Vimeo!

You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.</p><p><strong><em>Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?</em></strong></p><p>One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.</p><p> <strong><em>Why can’t I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?</em></strong></p><p>If you’re a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos. Only the Vimeo Pro, Premium, Business, and Enterprise members can add the chapters to video. Moreover, make sure you’re adding less than 100 chapters per video with a title of fewer than 50 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-beyond-the-buzz-a-ranked-guide-to-non-vimeo-edits/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Beyond the Buzz A Ranked Guide to Non-Vimeo Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-iconic-acting-peek-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Iconic Acting Peek - Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/cashing-in-on-creativity-the-vimeo-income-playbook-for-2024/"><u>Cashing in on Creativity The Vimeo Income Playbook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/descubre-los-mejores-convertidores-de-video-gratuitos-para-windows-11-y-entiende-su-exito-en-la-optimizacion-multimedia/"><u>Descubre Los Mejores Convertidores De Vídeo Gratuitos Para Windows 11 Y Entiende Su Éxito en La Optimización Multimedia</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/up-your-content-with-these-effective-freefire-video-hashtags-for-2024/"><u>Game Up Your Content with These Effective FreeFire Video Hashtags for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-id-locked-or-disabled-from-apple-iphone-11-pro-7-mehtods-you-cant-miss-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Apple ID Locked or Disabled From Apple iPhone 11 Pro? 7 Mehtods You Cant-Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-video-creation-learn-basic-edits-on-vimeo-for-free/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Video Creation Learn Basic Edits on Vimeo for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-your-snapchat-story-cinematography/"><u>In 2024, Perfecting Your Snapchat Story Cinematography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-tutorial-how-to-bypass-vivo-y200-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step Tutorial How To Bypass Vivo Y200 FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/navigating-imovie-video-submissions-to-vimeo/"><u>Navigating iMovie Video Submissions to Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/revolutionize-your-recording-experience-top-18-cam-tools-showcase-for-2024/"><u>Revolutionize Your Recording Experience - Top 18 Cam Tools Showcase for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-xboxs-video-conferencing-feature/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Xbox's Video Conferencing Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/1723009374231-troubleshoot-and-enhance-your-steam-remote-play-experience-today/"><u>Troubleshoot and Enhance Your Steam Remote Play Experience Today!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Introduce Vimeo Monetization Options and Explain What It Is</h2><h3 id="Vimeo-what-is-it"><a href="#Vimeo-what-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Vimeo - what is it?"></a>Vimeo - what is it?</h3><p>In 2004, Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein created Vimeo, an American video platform. At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972665/19272" target="_top" id="1972665">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972665" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972665/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand" class="headerlink" title="1.

Monetization of Vimeo vs. YouTube: Which is Most Effective?"></a>Part 3. Monetization of Vimeo vs. YouTube: Which is Most Effective?</h2><p>Videos can be uploaded and watched on the YouTube platform. Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization"><a href="#Options-for-monetization" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership. Exclusive content is available only to subscribers. It is possible for subscribers to conduct live chats and share separate streams.</p><h4 id="●-Vimeo-Monetization"><a href="#●-Vimeo-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● Vimeo Monetization"></a>● Vimeo Monetization</h4><p>Users of Vimeo can choose from a variety of business models. YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137976/21526" target="_top" id="2137976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137976/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization-1"><a href="#Options-for-monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable.

YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner.
