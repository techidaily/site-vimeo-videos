At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand" class="headerlink" title="1.

Monetization of Vimeo vs. YouTube: Which is Most Effective?"></a>Part 3. Monetization of Vimeo vs. YouTube: Which is Most Effective?</h2><p>Videos can be uploaded and watched on the YouTube platform. Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization"><a href="#Options-for-monetization" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership. Exclusive content is available only to subscribers. It is possible for subscribers to conduct live chats and share separate streams.</p><h4 id="●-Vimeo-Monetization"><a href="#●-Vimeo-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● Vimeo Monetization"></a>● Vimeo Monetization</h4><p>Users of Vimeo can choose from a variety of business models. YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner. Channel memberships and ad revenue are then available. It can be challenging to stand out on YouTube due to its vast audience reach.</p><p>It’s easier to be flexible with Vimeo. A percentage of your revenue is deducted from their fee. YouTube’s audience is also smaller, but Vimeo’s is typically more engaged. Quality over quantity makes it a good choice for creators. It’s about balancing audience size with potential earnings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Benefits-and-Drawbacks-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo"><a href="#Benefits-and-Drawbacks-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Benefits and Drawbacks of YouTube and Vimeo"></a>Benefits and Drawbacks of YouTube and Vimeo</h3><h4 id="Benefits-of-YouTube"><a href="#Benefits-of-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of YouTube"></a>Benefits of YouTube</h4><ul><li>YouTube boasts a massive user base, making it a go-to platform for maximum exposure.</li><li>It offers ad revenue sharing, sponsorships, and merchandise shelf options.</li><li>Creators can improve their content strategies with YouTube’s detailed analytics.</li><li>Platforms like YouTube are easy to use, well-known, and offer an extensive Creator Academy.</li></ul><h4 id="Drawbacks"><a href="#Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h4><ul><li>Subscribing to and standing out among the many creators can be difficult.</li><li>It’s not easy to get 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in 12 months.</li></ul><h4 id="Benefits-of-Vimeo"><a href="#Benefits-of-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Vimeo"></a>Benefits of Vimeo</h4><ul><li>High-quality content and a more professional audience are the hallmarks of Vimeo.</li><li>Vimeo takes a percentage of the revenue from creators, regardless of their following.</li><li>Vimeo allows for more branding and design customization of your video player and channel</li><li>Both creators and viewers will appreciate Vimeo’s ad-free experience.</li></ul><h4 id="Drawbacks-1"><a href="#Drawbacks-1" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h4><ul><li>Compared to YouTube, Vimeo is likely to reach fewer people.</li><li>Vimeo takes a percentage of your earnings instead of YouTube.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Unlocking-Filmora’s-Video-Editing-Tools-for-Vimeo-Content-Creators"><a href="#Part-4-Unlocking-Filmora’s-Video-Editing-Tools-for-Vimeo-Content-Creators" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization-1"><a href="#Options-for-monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership. Exclusive content is available only to subscribers. It is possible for subscribers to conduct live chats and share separate streams.</p><h4 id="●-Vimeo-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-Vimeo-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● Vimeo Monetization"></a>● Vimeo Monetization</h4><p>Users of Vimeo can choose from a variety of business models. YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner.

A percentage of your revenue is deducted from their fee. YouTube’s audience is also smaller, but Vimeo’s is typically more engaged. Quality over quantity makes it a good choice for creators.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896546/19272" target="_top" id="1896546">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896546" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896546/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand" class="headerlink" title="1.

Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization"><a href="#Options-for-monetization" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership. Exclusive content is available only to subscribers. It is possible for subscribers to conduct live chats and share separate streams.</p><h4 id="●-Vimeo-Monetization"><a href="#●-Vimeo-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● Vimeo Monetization"></a>● Vimeo Monetization</h4><p>Users of Vimeo can choose from a variety of business models. YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484939/16446" target="_top" id="1484939">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484939" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484939/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner. Channel memberships and ad revenue are then available. It can be challenging to stand out on YouTube due to its vast audience reach.</p><p>It’s easier to be flexible with Vimeo. A percentage of your revenue is deducted from their fee. YouTube’s audience is also smaller, but Vimeo’s is typically more engaged. Quality over quantity makes it a good choice for creators.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization-1"><a href="#Options-for-monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership. Exclusive content is available only to subscribers. It is possible for subscribers to conduct live chats and share separate streams.</p><h4 id="●-Vimeo-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-Vimeo-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● Vimeo Monetization"></a>● Vimeo Monetization</h4><p>Users of Vimeo can choose from a variety of business models. YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner. Channel memberships and ad revenue are then available. It can be challenging to stand out on YouTube due to its vast audience reach.</p><p>It’s easier to be flexible with Vimeo. A percentage of your revenue is deducted from their fee. YouTube’s audience is also smaller, but Vimeo’s is typically more engaged. Quality over quantity makes it a good choice for creators. It’s about balancing audience size with potential earnings.</p><h3 id="Benefits-and-Drawbacks-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo-1"><a href="#Benefits-and-Drawbacks-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="Benefits and Drawbacks of YouTube and Vimeo"></a>Benefits and Drawbacks of YouTube and Vimeo</h3><h4 id="Benefits-of-YouTube-1"><a href="#Benefits-of-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of YouTube"></a>Benefits of YouTube</h4><ul><li>YouTube boasts a massive user base, making it a go-to platform for maximum exposure.</li><li>It offers ad revenue sharing, sponsorships, and merchandise shelf options.</li><li>Creators can improve their content strategies with YouTube’s detailed analytics.</li><li>Platforms like YouTube are easy to use, well-known, and offer an extensive Creator Academy.</li></ul><h4 id="Drawbacks-2"><a href="#Drawbacks-2" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h4><ul><li>Subscribing to and standing out among the many creators can be difficult.</li><li>It’s not easy to get 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in 12 months.</li></ul><h4 id="Benefits-of-Vimeo-1"><a href="#Benefits-of-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Vimeo"></a>Benefits of Vimeo</h4><ul><li>High-quality content and a more professional audience are the hallmarks of Vimeo.</li><li>Vimeo takes a percentage of the revenue from creators, regardless of their following.</li><li>Vimeo allows for more branding and design customization of your video player and channel</li><li>Both creators and viewers will appreciate Vimeo’s ad-free experience.</li></ul><h4 id="Drawbacks-3"><a href="#Drawbacks-3" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h4><ul><li>Compared to YouTube, Vimeo is likely to reach fewer people.</li><li>Vimeo takes a percentage of your earnings instead of YouTube.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Unlocking-Filmora’s-Video-Editing-Tools-for-Vimeo-Content-Creators-1"><a href="#Part-4-Unlocking-Filmora’s-Video-Editing-Tools-for-Vimeo-Content-Creators-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100527/7443" target="_top" id="2100527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand" class="headerlink" title="1.

Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization"><a href="#Options-for-monetization" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership. Exclusive content is available only to subscribers. It is possible for subscribers to conduct live chats and share separate streams.</p><h4 id="●-Vimeo-Monetization"><a href="#●-Vimeo-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● Vimeo Monetization"></a>● Vimeo Monetization</h4><p>Users of Vimeo can choose from a variety of business models. YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner.

A percentage of your revenue is deducted from their fee. YouTube’s audience is also smaller, but Vimeo’s is typically more engaged. Quality over quantity makes it a good choice for creators.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Monetization of Vimeo vs. YouTube: Which is Most Effective?"></a>Part 3. Monetization of Vimeo vs. YouTube: Which is Most Effective?</h2><p>Videos can be uploaded and watched on the YouTube platform. Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization-1"><a href="#Options-for-monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership. Exclusive content is available only to subscribers. It is possible for subscribers to conduct live chats and share separate streams.</p><h4 id="●-Vimeo-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-Vimeo-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● Vimeo Monetization"></a>● Vimeo Monetization</h4><p>Users of Vimeo can choose from a variety of business models. YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148648/16836" target="_top" id="2148648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148648/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075483/7443" target="_top" id="2075483">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075483" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075483/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner.

In this section, you can select and upload the media you want to use, with a wide variety of formats supported including (JPG, JPEg, GIF, PNG, AVI, MP4, MPG, and many more).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-vimeo-storyboard.jpg"                      alt="Vimeo Create Storyboard"                ></p><p>Media can be imported from various sources, including your device, your Google Photos account, Vimeo Library, or external web repositories of stock photos and videos.

Music can add another layer to the story and make the video more appealing to the audience, but you need to be aware of certain limitations imposed by Vimeo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-video-create-add-music.jpg"                      alt="Vimeo Create add music"                ></p><p>You can use audio content from Vimeo’s own library, but if you upload your own music you won’t be able to share the video on Vimeo, even if you own a license.

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-leading-apps-top-10-choices-for-seamless-vimeo-file-extraction/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Leading Apps Top 10 Choices for Seamless Vimeo File Extraction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pinnacle-headlines-engineer/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Pinnacle Headlines Engineer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-recording-google-voice-a-comprehensive-tutorial-for-2024/"><u>[New] Recording Google Voice A Comprehensive Tutorial for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-a-compre-cookies-guide-to-marketing-magic-with-20-terms/"><u>[Updated] A Compre Cookie's Guide to Marketing Magic with 20 Terms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-engaging-followers-on-instagram-with-youtube-video-links-in-stories/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Engaging Followers on Instagram with YouTube Video Links in Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-5-cost-effective-video-editing-software-for-gamers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 5 Cost-Effective Video Editing Software (For Gamers)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-syncopated-science-of-video-and-music-on-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] The Syncopated Science of Video and Music on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-breach-overcome-restoring-your-facebook-access/"><u>2024 Approved Breach Overcome Restoring Your Facebook Access</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/comparing-iphones-best-video-editors-cameo-and-filmorago/"><u>Comparing iPhone's Best Video Editors Cameo & FilmoraGo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-solutions-for-honor-100-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Solutions For Honor 100 Unlock Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-vimeo-cutting-suite-revealed/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Vimeo Cutting Suite Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/overcoming-windows-camera-app-glitch-a00f425d/"><u>Overcoming Windows Camera App Glitch: A00F425D</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-how-to-bypass-swipe-screen-to-unlock-on-infinix-note-30-5g-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide How to Bypass Swipe Screen to Unlock on Infinix Note 30 5G Device</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.</p><p><strong><em>Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?</em></strong></p><p>One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.</p><p> <strong><em>Why can’t I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?</em></strong></p><p>If you’re a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos. Only the Vimeo Pro, Premium, Business, and Enterprise members can add the chapters to video. Moreover, make sure you’re adding less than 100 chapters per video with a title of fewer than 50 characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-snapchat-boomerangs-unveiled-your-how-to-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] SnapChat Boomerangs Unveiled – Your How-To Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-unraveling-the-secrets-to-smooth-vimeo-video-downloads/"><u>[New] Unraveling the Secrets to Smooth Vimeo Video Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-explore-the-limitless-potential-of-fb-vr-upload-tips/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Explore the Limitless Potential of FB VR Upload Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vimeo-overview-the-world-of-independent-film-hosting/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Vimeo Overview The World of Independent Film Hosting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-reimagining-user-engagement-top-10-video-editors-outside-vimeo-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Reimagining User Engagement Top 10 Video Editors Outside Vimeo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/explore-free-vimeo-video-editing-tips-and-tricks/"><u>Explore Free Vimeo Video Editing Tips and Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-simple-and-effective-ways-to-change-your-country-on-youtube-app-of-your-samsung-galaxy-a24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Simple and Effective Ways to Change Your Country on YouTube App Of your Samsung Galaxy A24 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/precision-viewing-at-a-glance-quick-minigame-tips/"><u>Precision Viewing at a Glance Quick Minigame Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/restoring-audibility-in-twitch-streams-effective-troubleshooting-techniques/"><u>Restoring Audibility in Twitch Streams: Effective Troubleshooting Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/win10-playback-problems-eliminating-no-playable-content-found-messages-efficiently/"><u>Win10 Playback Problems: Eliminating 'No Playable Content Found' Messages Efficiently!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

But if you want to record the Vimeo video screen on mobile, you can do that.</p><p>Android devices, including Android 10, offer <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >built-in screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here is how to capture the content of your Android mobile screen:</p><p>In the Quick Settings menu, launch Screen Recording. Of course, depending on the purpose of your video, you can allow access to mic only, camera only, or both. At the beginning of the process, you will see a short countdown - 3, 2, 1, and the recording starts. Piece of cake!</p><p>After you are done performing all the actions on your phone that you want to share on Vimeo, just stop recording and your video will be saved automatically in the cloud. You can download videos to your phone or share them instantly through one or more social media platforms. It’s not hard to stay in touch with all the recordings and get notifications whenever someone views the video and comments. Using this approach for business will put you in a better position in the market and stimulate engagement with the customers.</p><p>If you are using the iOS devices, you can record the Vimeo video screen with the in-built screen recorder feature if your iPhone is running iOS 11 and later versions.

This software suite is packed with professional-level options and stunning visual effects, allowing you to do far more than simply capture the screen. Among other things, you can precisely define which section of the screen to record, eliminate camera shake effect or noise, add music to the background, and improve the quality of your videos in many creative ways.</p><p>In other words, using Filmora to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record your screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and webcam gives you additional options to express yourself and fulfill your business objectives while saving time for you and your team. Of course, Filmora X can share the content directly to Vimeo or save it for further editing.</p><p>Starting a screen recording in Filmora X is a straightforward process as you just have to navigate to the <strong>Record</strong> drop-down menu, and then select the <strong>Record PC Screen</strong> option. A new window will pop up on your screen where you can adjust the settings for your next screen capturing session.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen.jpg"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Screen Record"                ></p><p>The software lets you specify the area of the screen you want to capture or record the entire screen, as well as choose the preferred video resolution. In addition, you have to make sure that external microphone is selected in the audio menu if you want to narrate your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-3.jpg"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Screen Record Options"                ></p><p>Furthermore, ticking the <strong>Record the Camera Stream</strong> checkbox at the bottom of the window will enable you to capture the screen and webcam feed simultaneously. When ready, you should click on the Red Record button to initiate the screen recording session.</p><p>Filmora X lets you pause the recording whenever you want, while you can also use the Record Timer box to limit the duration of the session. After you’ve recorded the footage, you can use the video editor’s tools to polish the footage before exporting it or uploading it to your Vimeo account.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora  Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora   Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Quick Fix: Why I Can’t Use Vimeo Recorder on My Mac Computer?</strong></p><p>After installing the Vimeo screen recorder, Mac users sometimes need to perform a few preparatory steps to allow the extension to launch. Open System Preferences, and click the Security &amp; Privacy icon. Scroll to Screen Recording, and allow Google Chrome access to the content of the screen.</p><p>Of course, at this point, you’ll also have to grant permission to access your camera and microphone. Once you activate all the necessary options, restart Chrome and full range of screen capturing tools will be at your disposal.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Possibilities for personal and professional communication are almost unlimited once you master the advanced features of the Vimeo screen recorder of your choice. Regardless of your choice of software tools, it’s very easy to produce high-end educational materials and how-to-do videos, or simply share your current thoughts with online friends.</p><p>However, if you have an ambitious project, built-in screen recording tools may not be sufficiently advanced. Using the Wondershare Filmora X to record and edit Vimeo clips based on the feed from your screen and webcam is a better option, especially for users who understand how to effectively use the finer video-making features of this incredible software. You can even record your mobile screen and create videos nearly instantly, so your creativity is virtually unbound when you have the right tools in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037346/7443" target="_top" id="2037346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037346/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-best-offline-ios-game-selection-for-screen-time-savor-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Offline iOS Game Selection for Screen Time Savor for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-culminating-sound-merging-music-with-vimeo-media-assets/"><u>[New] Culminating Sound Merging Music with Vimeo Media Assets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ssential-youtube-movie-binge-guides/"><u>[New] Essential YouTube Movie Binge Guides</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-get-started-on-vimeo-for-free-the-basics-of-video-editing-for-2024/"><u>[New] Get Started on Vimeo for Free The Basics of Video Editing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-streaming-giants-rivalry-facebook-vs-youtube-and-spaces/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streaming Giants' Rivalry Facebook Vs.
