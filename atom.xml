At this point you can also upload captions, subtitles or thumbnails to make the videos stand out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934142/19272" target="_top" id="1934142">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934142" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934142/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-exploring-samsung-galaxy-s8s-4k-superiority/"><u>[New] Exploring Samsung Galaxy S8's 4K Superiority</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/avigating-through-top-9-youtube-download-apps-on-android-devices/"><u>[New] Navigating Through Top 9 YouTube Download Apps on Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-essential-guide-to-earnings-monetizing-content-on-vimeo/"><u>[New] The Essential Guide to Earnings Monetizing Content on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-vimeo-content-step-by-step-free-and-licensed-tools-guide/"><u>[New] Unlocking Vimeo Content Step-by-Step Free & Licensed Tools Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-download-vimeo-to-mp4-files/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Download Vimeo to MP4 Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-conquer-youtube-vimeo-editing-5-advanced-trimming-strategies/"><u>[Updated] Conquer YouTube-Vimeo Editing 5 Advanced Trimming Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-professional-guide-extracting-vimeo-content-as-mp4s/"><u>[Updated] Professional Guide Extracting Vimeo Content as MP4s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/best-10-mock-location-apps-worth-trying-on-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Best 10 Mock Location Apps Worth Trying On Samsung Galaxy F54 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/capture-vimeo-essence-the-art-of-transforming-into-a-gif/"><u>Capture Vimeo Essence The Art of Transforming Into a GIF</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-working-guide-for-pachirisu-pokemon-go-map-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/navigating-git-branches-using-github-desktop-in-win-11/"><u>Navigating Git Branches Using GitHub Desktop in Win 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-get-the-rare-candy-on-pokemon-go-fire-red-on-infinix-hot-30i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Infinix Hot 30i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-4-ways-to-trace-vivo-x100-pro-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 4 Ways to Trace Vivo X100 Pro Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Storage"></a>1. Storage</h4><p> If we talk about storage space then Vimeo Basic account offers maximum upload of only 500MB&#x2F; per or in other words, you can access 25GB for one year. In case of Vimeo Plus account, 5GB space is available to users per week and for one year they can access maximum 250GB. If we move towards then Vimeo Pro account then users here will be able to get 20GB &#x2F;week and huge storage space of 1TB for year.</p><h4 id="2-Customization-3"><a href="#2-Customization-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization"></a>2. Customization</h4><p> The Vimeo basic free version cannot assist users with video customization features but outro and video player can be customized in case of Vimeo Plus account. Further, Vimeo Pro account assist users in advanced personalization features like facility to add logos, create customized outro etc. It also offers third party support for players.</p><h4 id="3-Pricacy-and-Stats-3"><a href="#3-Pricacy-and-Stats-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Pricacy and Stats"></a>3. Pricacy and Stats</h4><p> The Basic account can be accessed for free but it still offers so many incredible features like no duration limit, no advertisements, Video password protection as well as basic video conversion features. Users can see how many people liked and viewed their videos on channel. If you want to access Vimeo Plus account then pay $59.95&#x2F;year and $9.95&#x2F;month; the feature set is improved with addition of priority support, unlimited channel, albums and groups. Plus account users can avail information about video embed and viewers details. As Vimeo Pro offers so many advanced features like VIO support and advanced stats data so the cost also goes high up to $199&#x2F;year package for 1TB storage space and $399&#x2F;year for 3TB space.</p><h4 id="4-Support-3"><a href="#4-Support-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Support"></a>4. Support</h4><p> If you are using Vimeo basic account then you must expect to get answers for your queries within 3 business days. The Vimeo Plus account users can avail response from support team within 4 hours during business days. The best thing to know about highly advanced Vimeo pro account users is that users can get answers for their queries within one hour and it stays active 24 hours even on weekends.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that basic membership option is great option for beginners but in case if you are in search of priority support service, privacy control, huge storage space, player customization and few other advanced tools then Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro will be more suitable to you. Price range also matters so prefer to pick your software tool as per your budget and needs to have best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-high-quality-fast-downloaders-for-vimeo-content-for-2024/"><u>[New] High-Quality, Fast Downloaders for Vimeo Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-organizing-video-content-with-vimeo-chapters/"><u>[New] In 2024, Organizing Video Content with Vimeo Chapters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-vimeo-in-a-nutshell-the-video-sharing-experience/"><u>[New] In 2024, Vimeo in a Nutshell The Video Sharing Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-from-single-shots-to-spectaculary-screenshots/"><u>[Updated] From Single Shots to Spectaculary Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-thumbnail-strategies-for-amplifying-viewership-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Thumbnail Strategies for Amplifying Viewership on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-superior-tools-for-downloading-vimeo-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Superior Tools for Downloading Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/a-beginners-guide-to-vimeo-caption-addition-for-2024/"><u>A Beginner's Guide to Vimeo Caption Addition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-bytes.techidaily.com/best-practices-for-an-aesthetically-pleasing-instagram-presence-tips-and-strategies/"><u>Best Practices for an Aesthetically Pleasing Instagram Presence : Tips and Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-simulate-gps-movement-with-location-spoofer-on-vivo-y78plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Vivo Y78+? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-unique-facebook-video-content/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Unique Facebook Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-editing-supremacy-cameo-vs-filmorago-face-off/"><u>In 2024, IPhone Editing Supremacy Cameo Vs.

You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.</p><p><strong><em>Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?</em></strong></p><p>One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.</p><p> <strong><em>Why can’t I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?</em></strong></p><p>If you’re a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos.

You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.</p><p> <strong><em>Why can’t I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?</em></strong></p><p>If you’re a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos.

Cameo"></a>2. Cameo</h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo to use on your iPhone or iPad then Cameo is a great choice. It’s free to download and you can pretty much edit anywhere with just your phone and Cameo as your tools. You are able to combine numerous clips from your phones camera roll to enable the editing mode. You can then trim as well as splice with ease. The professionalism comes from the video filters and you can even add themes and soundtracks to suit your video. The only problem with Cameo is that it is only available on iOS devices so android users will have to use an alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-caption-cameo.jpg"                      alt="vimeo"                ></p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Cameo Review-Video Editor &amp; Movie Maker for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Vimeo"></a>Free Video Editor for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="Free-Online-Video-Editor"><a href="#Free-Online-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Free Online Video Editor"></a><strong>Free Online Video Editor</strong></h4><h4 id="1-Kizoa"><a href="#1-Kizoa" class="headerlink" title="1. Kizoa"></a>1. Kizoa</h4><p>The first of the best video editor for Filmora without having to pay is Kizoa. You are able to cut your video clips, add intros and outros with numerous professional pre made effects and even add a soundtrack to your films and picture slideshows. It’s simple to use and cloud based making it ideal for editing anywhere you have access to the internet, however it does only allow for 10 second videos using a free account, 1GB of data and you will need to download a player should you wish to burn the videos onto DVD. If you only wish to find the best video editor for Filmora for short videos then it’s ideal as you can edit, store, share and access a lot of effects to make your clips look professional. For longer videos another editor would be better suited.</p><h4 id="2-Wevideo"><a href="#2-Wevideo" class="headerlink" title="2. Wevideo"></a>2. Wevideo</h4><p>More and more people are using the cloud on the internet from backups to project managing and edits. What can make editors in the cloud difficult to use is the time it can take to upload videos as most people face the upload connections being slower than downloads. With WeVideo you can use cloud based storage which allows for seamless uploading and of course save space on your hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg"                      alt="how to use wevideo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You can use your mobile devices and PC’s to upload your videos automatically to the cloud. You will then be able to drag them into the editor without delay and best of all, easily. It’s so easy to edit your videos with WeVideo whether you want to trim or add transitions. There are also lots of soundtracks for you to add to your videos and you can even fade the audio in and out for a professional effect. You can even get friends to upload their videos if you wish and add them to your own footage making collaboration easy.</p><p>As a free user you will only be able to export 480p videos and they are watermarked. This is unfortunately not upfront and only shows once you have completed your edit. It is however easy enough to connect to the most popular video services making it easier to share.</p><p>Reas also: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >WeVideo: Easily Create Videos Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-PC"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-PC" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for PC"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for PC</strong></h4><p>On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose. When looking for a free editor be aware than many free versions have limitations which is why we have listed our favourites below.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-Movie-Maker"><a href="#1-Windows-Movie-Maker" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows Movie Maker"></a>1. Windows Movie Maker</h4><p>One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lightworks"><a href="#2-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="2. Lightworks"></a>2. Lightworks</h4><p>Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:</p><h4 id="1-Shotcut"><a href="#1-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="1. Shotcut"></a>1. Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037334/7443" target="_top" id="2037334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037334/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Avidemux"><a href="#2-Avidemux" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful. It’s simple to use but it can take a while to get used to the layout which could put off someone who is new to editing altogether.

There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:</p><h4 id="1-Shotcut-3"><a href="#1-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shotcut"></a>1. Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><h4 id="2-Avidemux-3"><a href="#2-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful. It’s simple to use but it can take a while to get used to the layout which could put off someone who is new to editing altogether. You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.</p><p>Detailed Guides to Help You Get Started</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Avidemux to Edit Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop a Video with Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text&#x2F;subtitles with Avidemux? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Filmora-Android-3"><a href="#1-Filmora-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora ( Android"></a>1. Filmora ( Android</h4><p>If you are looking for a video editor for free then the Filmora free version is a great place to start. The software is powerful and has numerous settings to help you to edit your videos to make them look professional giving novices access to edits that would have previously only been available for pro’s who can afford the expensive alternative software. It’s simple to add your videos to edit using a drag and drop function and has support for text, titles, animated text and music. IT also has an array of filters and overlays. Over 100 effects can be incorporated and you can slow down and speed up your videos for added effect. It can be used on both apple and android devices allowing you to edit and upload your videos faster than ever before.</p><h4 id="2-Magisto-iOS-3"><a href="#2-Magisto-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Magisto ( iOS"></a>2. Magisto ( iOS</h4><p>The Magisto free video editor allows you to change any photo or video into a music video that can be shared on social networking sites, email and more. Magisto is aimed at novices to give them a way to create videos that look professional by either turning a few stills into a slideshow to music or altering a video. It’s fun and easy to use, so much so that it has been used in many classroom projects thanks to the automated video production functions. The free version is more of a way to give you a demonstration than being a standalone free editor and you do have to pay the subscription price to be able to access more functions as the production lengths are limited. The automated editing can be off-putting for those looking for the best video editor for Vimeo above a novice level due to the automation, but is perfect for those just finding their feet.</p><h4 id="3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3"><a href="#3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS"></a>3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS</h4><p>One of the best video editor for Vimeo is Quick by GoPro thanks to the fact it has been created to work well for those that want a fast way to edit yet have professionalism in the final cuts. It’s not difficult to set up but it does require 112MB of space and QuickTime to function. For people with a slow connection to the internet or little space on their hard drive this could prove problematic. For new users there is a tutorial to help them find their way around and lots of control over editing including exposure and white balance. There are also numerous pre-set filters to get a professional look whether it’s your first or 1000th time of video editing. Although a great product it does still have a few bugs that need ironing out including the fact that it can crash for seemingly no reason. Aside from this there are numerous functions that would rival quite a few paid editors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145079/17095" target="_top" id="2145079">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145079" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145079/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-efficiently-design-your-google-image-mosaic-today/"><u>[New] Efficiently Design Your Google Image Mosaic Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-comparing-iphones-best-video-editors-cameo-and-filmorago/"><u>[New] In 2024, Comparing iPhone's Best Video Editors Cameo & FilmoraGo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-maximizing-buzz-making-hype-on-twitter-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Maximizing Buzz Making Hype on Twitter Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-skincare-and-sensational-looks/"><u>[Updated] Skincare and Sensational Looks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/caixuns-budget-75-inch-4k-smart-television-evaluation-performance-breakdown/"><u>Caixun's Budget 75-Inch 4K Smart Television Evaluation - Performance Breakdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/conquer-youtube-vimeo-editing-5-advanced-trimming-strategies/"><u>Conquer YouTube-Vimeo Editing 5 Advanced Trimming Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-problem-on-vivo-y100i-power-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Problem on Vivo Y100i Power 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-visual-stories-editing-music-for-canva-clips/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Visual Stories Editing Music for Canva Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/innovative-guide-transforming-social-media-sounds-into-mobile-alerts/"><u>Innovative Guide Transforming Social Media Sounds Into Mobile Alerts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/speaker-check-fast-and-simple-guide-to-testing-your-mic/"><u>Speaker Check: Fast and Simple Guide to Testing Your Mic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-chronological-viewing-list-of-the-superman-franchise/"><u>The Ultimate Chronological Viewing List of the Superman Franchise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/unleashing-conversational-ai-on-your-phone-the-new-chatgpt-for-android-users/"><u>Unleashing Conversational AI on Your Phone - The New ChatGPT for Android Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/unlocking-vimeo-content-step-by-step-free-and-licensed-tools-guide-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Vimeo Content Step-by-Step Free & Licensed Tools Guide for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In case of Vimeo Plus account, 5GB space is available to users per week and for one year they can access maximum 250GB. If we move towards then Vimeo Pro account then users here will be able to get 20GB &#x2F;week and huge storage space of 1TB for year.</p><h4 id="2-Customization-2"><a href="#2-Customization-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Users can see how many people liked and viewed their videos on channel. If you want to access Vimeo Plus account then pay $59.95&#x2F;year and $9.95&#x2F;month; the feature set is improved with addition of priority support, unlimited channel, albums and groups. Plus account users can avail information about video embed and viewers details. As Vimeo Pro offers so many advanced features like VIO support and advanced stats data so the cost also goes high up to $199&#x2F;year package for 1TB storage space and $399&#x2F;year for 3TB space.</p><h4 id="4-Support-2"><a href="#4-Support-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

The Vimeo Plus account users can avail response from support team within 4 hours during business days. The best thing to know about highly advanced Vimeo pro account users is that users can get answers for their queries within one hour and it stays active 24 hours even on weekends.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that basic membership option is great option for beginners but in case if you are in search of priority support service, privacy control, huge storage space, player customization and few other advanced tools then Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro will be more suitable to you.

With an excellent battery, cool features, and a comfortable fit, the Apple Watch Series 9 is a great buy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-MmQLsH_4EYd8KhLmLkRZehkEQY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AppleWatch9_wrist-69497d2de4864606b425effeba1dca5c.jpg"                      alt="Apple Watch Series 9 on a wrist."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151865/7443" target="_top" id="2151865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151865/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire&#x2F;Molly McLaughlin</p><p> I haven’t used many smartwatches, but I remember when a smartwatch wouldn’t last through the day. Thankfully, that’s not the case with the Series 9, which has yet to die on me (aside from when I unknowingly unplugged its charger right before bed).</p><p> It offers conveniences, too, not just “nice to haves,” the top one being using Apple Pay at the register. (No fumbling around for my phone or wallet.) And using it to swipe onto the subway feels like a luxury.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-apple-watch-4589317" >How to Set Up Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Pricing-and-What’s-New"><a href="#Pricing-and-What’s-New" class="headerlink" title="Pricing and What’s New"></a>Pricing and What’s New</h2><p> The Apple Watch Series 9 costs $399 for Wi-Fi only, the same as the Series 8 &amp; 7. To add Cellular, pricing starts at $499.

After a few bike rides where my average speed was skewed because I forgot to pause or unpause the workout during or after a break, I was pleased to find that you can enable automatic pausing (auto-pause) for biking and running.</p><p> In my experience, the watch was quick to pause when I stopped at traffic lights and resume once I started moving again. (This is also helpful if you forget to end a workout.)</p><h2 id="Who-Should-Buy-It"><a href="#Who-Should-Buy-It" class="headerlink" title="Who Should Buy It?"></a>Who Should Buy It?</h2><p> If you have a Series 6 or older, it’s worth moving up to the Series 9 as you’re likely dealing with declining performance and a more easily depleted battery. The Series 9 costs the same as the Series 7 and 8, so there’s little reason to purchase last year’s model.</p><p> You can use your old watch bands and cases on a newer model, which is convenient.</p><p> On the other hand, if you have an Apple Watch Series 7 or later that works well and has a good battery, there’s little reason to upgrade. (The Series 4 and newer watches are eligible for watchOS 10 if you have an iPhone XS or more recent.)</p><p> One thing to know is that if you get an Apple Watch, you should have an iPhone too. It doesn’t play well with Android smartphones and won’t pair over Bluetooth.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-vs-fitbit-8650200" >I Tried Both: Apple Watch Series 9 vs Fitbit Charge 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-apple-watch-4584460" >Smart Watches &amp; Wearables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Watch Series 9 GPS + Cellular 45mm</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Case Options  45mm and 41mm aluminum or stainless steel</li><li>Battery Life  Up to 18 hours (36 in Low Power Mode)</li><li>Processor  Apple S9</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-master-class-extracting-and-saving-vimeo-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Master Class Extracting and Saving Vimeo Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlock-vimeos-potential-cutting-edge-video-tools/"><u>[New] Unlock Vimeo's Potential Cutting Edge Video Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-integrating-subtitles-into-your-vimeo-projects/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Integrating Subtitles Into Your Vimeo Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-brief-stardom-flash-review-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Brief Stardom Flash Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-erase-effortlessly-social-media-live-on-desktop-and-phone-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Erase Effortlessly Social Media Live on Desktop & Phone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-improving-user-experience-vimeo-video-subtitles/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Improving User Experience Vimeo Video Subtitles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-master-your-media-on-vimeo-with-top-ranked-editors/"><u>2024 Approved Master Your Media on Vimeo with Top-Ranked Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/easy-guide-microsoft-drivers-installation-and-updates-on-windows-11-8-and-7/"><u>Easy Guide: Microsoft Drivers Installation and Updates on Windows 11, 8, and 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/enjoy-anytime-anywhere-with-our-12-channel-stream-for-2024/"><u>Enjoy Anytime, Anywhere with Our 12 Channel Stream for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/expert-techniques-for-downloading-vimeo-clips-mp4/"><u>Expert Techniques for Downloading Vimeo Clips (MP4)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-samsung-galaxy-f04-to-outlook-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Contacts from Samsung Galaxy F04 to Outlook | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-i-use-a-fake-gps-without-mock-location-on-vivo-x-flip-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can I Use a Fake GPS Without Mock Location On Vivo X Flip?

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037319/7443" target="_top" id="2037319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037319/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand" class="headerlink" title="1.

Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization"><a href="#Options-for-monetization" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership.

YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner.

A percentage of your revenue is deducted from their fee. YouTube’s audience is also smaller, but Vimeo’s is typically more engaged. Quality over quantity makes it a good choice for creators.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915810/19272" target="_top" id="1915810">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915810" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915810/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Monetization of Vimeo vs. YouTube: Which is Most Effective?"></a>Part 3. Monetization of Vimeo vs. YouTube: Which is Most Effective?</h2><p>Videos can be uploaded and watched on the YouTube platform. Since its founding in 2005, YouTube has amassed 2 billion users and 51 million channels. In contrast, Vimeo allows businesses to share video content, and hosts and streams video content. In addition to having over 200 million active users, Vimeo hosts 1.5 million videos for a fee.</p><h3 id="Options-for-monetization-1"><a href="#Options-for-monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="Options for monetization"></a>Options for monetization</h3><h4 id="●-YouTube-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-YouTube-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● YouTube Monetization"></a>● YouTube Monetization</h4><p>Creators need to meet YouTube’s requirements in order to earn money from their videos. Posting content from a monetization-eligible country will help you do this. A minimum of 1,000 subscribers is required. Watched 4,000 hours or more in the previous 12 months. Your videos’ ad revenue will be shared with YouTube once you meet the listed parameters. The company splits revenue with creators 45&#x2F;55 when they meet the requirements.</p><p>The content creator will still get money if YouTube Premium subscribers watch videos without ads. YouTube users’ earnings decline over time, so income does not remain stable. Creators cannot control this - they can only keep creating and posting videos.</p><p>Followers can also support their favorite creators by joining Channel Membership. Exclusive content is available only to subscribers. It is possible for subscribers to conduct live chats and share separate streams.</p><h4 id="●-Vimeo-Monetization-1"><a href="#●-Vimeo-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="● Vimeo Monetization"></a>● Vimeo Monetization</h4><p>Users of Vimeo can choose from a variety of business models. YouTube does not charge creators to post videos, unlike this platform. With Vimeo, you can rent content, sell it, or pay for Vimeo’s Pro plan to allow subscribers. You can also add a paywall with subscriptions or one-time fees on the videos. Creators choose monetization strategies based on their audience and goals. On YouTube, advertisers have no control over advertising.</p><p>You’ll need a PayPal account to withdraw money from Vimeo. Creators’ earnings are determined by tax rates and currencies in their countries. Gross earnings are usually taxed at 10%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-6.jpg"                      alt="vimeo vs youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129740/7443" target="_top" id="2129740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1"><a href="#Model-for-Revenue-Sharing-1" class="headerlink" title="Model for Revenue Sharing"></a>Model for Revenue Sharing</h3><p>Both websites are very different in terms of revenue generation. Vimeo offers its users four premium subscription plans. There are currently 30% savings from the usual $75&#x2F;month price to $7-56&#x2F;month. There are different subscription plans for data storage, business analytics, personalization, and privacy. Despite the free plan, Vimeo is not designed for business-related uses most people use it for. Membership fees are Vimeo’s only source of revenue since it is an ad-free platform.</p><p>Ads dominate YouTube, however. You will likely see ads on YouTube before, during, and after watching a video. YouTube generates revenue while advertisers can target virtually any audience. Advertisements shown with video content allow creators to monetize their content. Views need to be in the hundreds of thousands in order to generate anything substantial in ad revenue (55%).</p><h3 id="Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1"><a href="#Audience-Reach-and-Requirements-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Reach and Requirements"></a>Audience Reach and Requirements</h3><p>You need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours on your channel to become a YouTube Partner. Channel memberships and ad revenue are then available. It can be challenging to stand out on YouTube due to its vast audience reach.</p><p>It’s easier to be flexible with Vimeo. A percentage of your revenue is deducted from their fee. YouTube’s audience is also smaller, but Vimeo’s is typically more engaged. Quality over quantity makes it a good choice for creators. It’s about balancing audience size with potential earnings.</p><h3 id="Benefits-and-Drawbacks-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo-1"><a href="#Benefits-and-Drawbacks-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="Benefits and Drawbacks of YouTube and Vimeo"></a>Benefits and Drawbacks of YouTube and Vimeo</h3><h4 id="Benefits-of-YouTube-1"><a href="#Benefits-of-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of YouTube"></a>Benefits of YouTube</h4><ul><li>YouTube boasts a massive user base, making it a go-to platform for maximum exposure.</li><li>It offers ad revenue sharing, sponsorships, and merchandise shelf options.</li><li>Creators can improve their content strategies with YouTube’s detailed analytics.</li><li>Platforms like YouTube are easy to use, well-known, and offer an extensive Creator Academy.</li></ul><h4 id="Drawbacks-2"><a href="#Drawbacks-2" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h4><ul><li>Subscribing to and standing out among the many creators can be difficult.</li><li>It’s not easy to get 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in 12 months.</li></ul><h4 id="Benefits-of-Vimeo-1"><a href="#Benefits-of-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Vimeo"></a>Benefits of Vimeo</h4><ul><li>High-quality content and a more professional audience are the hallmarks of Vimeo.</li><li>Vimeo takes a percentage of the revenue from creators, regardless of their following.</li><li>Vimeo allows for more branding and design customization of your video player and channel</li><li>Both creators and viewers will appreciate Vimeo’s ad-free experience.</li></ul><h4 id="Drawbacks-3"><a href="#Drawbacks-3" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h4><ul><li>Compared to YouTube, Vimeo is likely to reach fewer people.</li><li>Vimeo takes a percentage of your earnings instead of YouTube.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Unlocking-Filmora’s-Video-Editing-Tools-for-Vimeo-Content-Creators-1"><a href="#Part-4-Unlocking-Filmora’s-Video-Editing-Tools-for-Vimeo-Content-Creators-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Cameo"></a>2. Cameo</h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo to use on your iPhone or iPad then Cameo is a great choice. It’s free to download and you can pretty much edit anywhere with just your phone and Cameo as your tools. You are able to combine numerous clips from your phones camera roll to enable the editing mode. You can then trim as well as splice with ease. The professionalism comes from the video filters and you can even add themes and soundtracks to suit your video. The only problem with Cameo is that it is only available on iOS devices so android users will have to use an alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-caption-cameo.jpg"                      alt="vimeo"                ></p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Cameo Review-Video Editor &amp; Movie Maker for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Vimeo"></a>Free Video Editor for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="Free-Online-Video-Editor"><a href="#Free-Online-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Free Online Video Editor"></a><strong>Free Online Video Editor</strong></h4><h4 id="1-Kizoa"><a href="#1-Kizoa" class="headerlink" title="1. Kizoa"></a>1. Kizoa</h4><p>The first of the best video editor for Filmora without having to pay is Kizoa. You are able to cut your video clips, add intros and outros with numerous professional pre made effects and even add a soundtrack to your films and picture slideshows. It’s simple to use and cloud based making it ideal for editing anywhere you have access to the internet, however it does only allow for 10 second videos using a free account, 1GB of data and you will need to download a player should you wish to burn the videos onto DVD. If you only wish to find the best video editor for Filmora for short videos then it’s ideal as you can edit, store, share and access a lot of effects to make your clips look professional. For longer videos another editor would be better suited.</p><h4 id="2-Wevideo"><a href="#2-Wevideo" class="headerlink" title="2. Wevideo"></a>2. Wevideo</h4><p>More and more people are using the cloud on the internet from backups to project managing and edits. What can make editors in the cloud difficult to use is the time it can take to upload videos as most people face the upload connections being slower than downloads. With WeVideo you can use cloud based storage which allows for seamless uploading and of course save space on your hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg"                      alt="how to use wevideo"                ></p><p>You can use your mobile devices and PC’s to upload your videos automatically to the cloud. You will then be able to drag them into the editor without delay and best of all, easily. It’s so easy to edit your videos with WeVideo whether you want to trim or add transitions. There are also lots of soundtracks for you to add to your videos and you can even fade the audio in and out for a professional effect. You can even get friends to upload their videos if you wish and add them to your own footage making collaboration easy.</p><p>As a free user you will only be able to export 480p videos and they are watermarked. This is unfortunately not upfront and only shows once you have completed your edit. It is however easy enough to connect to the most popular video services making it easier to share.</p><p>Reas also: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >WeVideo: Easily Create Videos Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-PC"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-PC" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for PC"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for PC</strong></h4><p>On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose. When looking for a free editor be aware than many free versions have limitations which is why we have listed our favourites below.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-Movie-Maker"><a href="#1-Windows-Movie-Maker" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows Movie Maker"></a>1. Windows Movie Maker</h4><p>One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video.

You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video.

With WeVideo you can use cloud based storage which allows for seamless uploading and of course save space on your hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg"                      alt="how to use wevideo"                ></p><p>You can use your mobile devices and PC’s to upload your videos automatically to the cloud. You will then be able to drag them into the editor without delay and best of all, easily. It’s so easy to edit your videos with WeVideo whether you want to trim or add transitions. There are also lots of soundtracks for you to add to your videos and you can even fade the audio in and out for a professional effect. You can even get friends to upload their videos if you wish and add them to your own footage making collaboration easy.</p><p>As a free user you will only be able to export 480p videos and they are watermarked. This is unfortunately not upfront and only shows once you have completed your edit. It is however easy enough to connect to the most popular video services making it easier to share.</p><p>Reas also: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >WeVideo: Easily Create Videos Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-PC-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for PC"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for PC</strong></h4><p>On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose. When looking for a free editor be aware than many free versions have limitations which is why we have listed our favourites below.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-Movie-Maker-3"><a href="#1-Windows-Movie-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows Movie Maker"></a>1. Windows Movie Maker</h4><p>One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg"                      alt="Video Editing -1"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lightworks-3"><a href="#2-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Lightworks"></a>2. Lightworks</h4><p>Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg"                      alt="free mp4 video editor"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484945/16446" target="_top" id="1484945">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484945" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484945/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Free-Video-Editor-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Video Editor for Mac"></a><strong>Free Video Editor for Mac</strong></h4><p>If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:</p><h4 id="1-Shotcut-3"><a href="#1-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shotcut"></a>1. Shotcut</h4><p>Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png"                      alt="linux adobe premiere alternative" title="linux adobe premiere alternative"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135400/19272" target="_top" id="2135400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135400/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Avidemux-3"><a href="#2-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avidemux"></a>2. Avidemux</h4><p>The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful. It’s simple to use but it can take a while to get used to the layout which could put off someone who is new to editing altogether. You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.</p><p>Detailed Guides to Help You Get Started</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Avidemux to Edit Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Crop a Video with Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text&#x2F;subtitles with Avidemux? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Filmora-Android-3"><a href="#1-Filmora-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora ( Android"></a>1. Filmora ( Android</h4><p>If you are looking for a video editor for free then the Filmora free version is a great place to start. The software is powerful and has numerous settings to help you to edit your videos to make them look professional giving novices access to edits that would have previously only been available for pro’s who can afford the expensive alternative software. It’s simple to add your videos to edit using a drag and drop function and has support for text, titles, animated text and music. IT also has an array of filters and overlays. Over 100 effects can be incorporated and you can slow down and speed up your videos for added effect. It can be used on both apple and android devices allowing you to edit and upload your videos faster than ever before.</p><h4 id="2-Magisto-iOS-3"><a href="#2-Magisto-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Magisto ( iOS"></a>2. Magisto ( iOS</h4><p>The Magisto free video editor allows you to change any photo or video into a music video that can be shared on social networking sites, email and more. Magisto is aimed at novices to give them a way to create videos that look professional by either turning a few stills into a slideshow to music or altering a video. It’s fun and easy to use, so much so that it has been used in many classroom projects thanks to the automated video production functions. The free version is more of a way to give you a demonstration than being a standalone free editor and you do have to pay the subscription price to be able to access more functions as the production lengths are limited. The automated editing can be off-putting for those looking for the best video editor for Vimeo above a novice level due to the automation, but is perfect for those just finding their feet.</p><h4 id="3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3"><a href="#3-Quik-by-GoPro-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS"></a>3. Quik by GoPro ( iOS</h4><p>One of the best video editor for Vimeo is Quick by GoPro thanks to the fact it has been created to work well for those that want a fast way to edit yet have professionalism in the final cuts. It’s not difficult to set up but it does require 112MB of space and QuickTime to function. For people with a slow connection to the internet or little space on their hard drive this could prove problematic. For new users there is a tutorial to help them find their way around and lots of control over editing including exposure and white balance. There are also numerous pre-set filters to get a professional look whether it’s your first or 1000th time of video editing. Although a great product it does still have a few bugs that need ironing out including the fact that it can crash for seemingly no reason. Aside from this there are numerous functions that would rival quite a few paid editors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-demystifying-virtual-meetings-essential-tips-for-using-zoom-win10/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Demystifying Virtual Meetings Essential Tips for Using Zoom (Win10)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-clear-cut-strategies-transferring-your-imovie-work-to-vimeo-for-2024/"><u>[New] Clear-Cut Strategies Transferring Your iMovie Work to Vimeo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-digital-illustration-turning-your-favorite-vimeo-videos-into-gifs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Digital Illustration Turning Your Favorite Vimeo Videos Into GIFs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlock-gif-potential-creating-animated-summaries-of-vimeo-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlock GIF Potential Creating Animated Summaries of Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-audiophiles-guide-selecting-prime-tools-for-vtuber-voice-alteration/"><u>[Updated] Audiophile's Guide Selecting Prime Tools for VTuber Voice Alteration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-captivating-video-content-tips-for-pinterest-boards/"><u>[Updated] Captivating Video Content Tips for Pinterest Boards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-smooth-transition-uploading-imovie-films-into-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Smooth Transition Uploading iMovie Films Into Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-which-vimeo-e-sy-option-suits-your-needs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Which Vimeo E-Sy Option Suits Your Needs?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/emoji-less-tweets-on-twitter-linuss-revelations-explored-trojan-explained-and-chatgpt-concerns-addressed/"><u>Emoji-Less Tweets on Twitter, Linus’s Revelations Explored, Trojan Explained, & ChatGPT Concerns Addressed.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/get-techkey-bluetooth-adapter-software-for-windows-installers-for-win-10-7-and-8-supported/"><u>Get Techkey Bluetooth Adapter Software for Windows: Installers for Win 10, 7 & #8; Supported</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-gps-location-on-oppo-find-x7-ultra-easily-and-safely-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 Ultra Easily & Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-we-unlock-our-nubia-red-magic-8s-pro-phone-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can We Unlock Our Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro Phone Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-strategies-to-speedy-up-vimeo-videos/"><u>In 2024, Strategies to Speedy Up Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/maximizing-video-sharing-adding-imovie-clips-to-vimeo-for-2024/"><u>Maximizing Video Sharing Adding iMovie Clips to Vimeo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-video-translator-app-for-pc-you-cannot-miss/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Best Video Translator App for PC You Cannot Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-professional-grade-glitch-video-editors-paid-and-free-solutions-compared/"><u>Updated Professional-Grade Glitch Video Editors Paid and Free Solutions Compared</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/versatile-tips-for-avoiding-vr-motion-sickness/"><u>Versatile Tips for Avoiding VR Motion Sickness</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
