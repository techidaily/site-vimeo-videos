Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-efficiency-and-speed/"><u>[New] In 2024, Efficiency and Speed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-the-complex-world-of-video-text-implementation-vimeo/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating the Complex World of Video Text Implementation (Vimeo)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-secrets-of-smooth-transfer-mcc-files-uploaded-on-vimeo/"><u>In 2024, Secrets of Smooth Transfer  MCC Files Uploaded on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-iphones-best-video-editor-pick-cameo-vs-filmorago-analysis/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, IPhone's Best Video Editor Pick  Cameo Vs.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand" class="headerlink" title="1.

At first, it was a website that collected funny videos as a spinoff of CollegeHumor. As Vimeo became part of IAC in 2006, it began focusing on high-definition video. The company makes money by providing subscription plans to businesses and content producers. Members have access to everything they need to create, edit, and broadcast videos. Software solutions are also available for corporate clients. Professionals in the video industry use Vimeo to find clients and projects.</p><p>In 2021, Vimeo had more than 230 million users, including 1.6 million paying subscribers. There are about 60 million content creators among its users. Guess what, in May 2021, when Vimeo, a cool video company, started selling its shares, each share was worth $52.08. This meant that they made $96 million that year. The increase is 42% over last year!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-make-money-on-vimeo-your-ultimate-guide-to-vimeo-monetization-1.JPG"                      alt="vimeo- what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1"><a href="#The-monetization-options-available-on-Vimeo-1" class="headerlink" title="The monetization options available on Vimeo"></a>The monetization options available on Vimeo</h3><h4 id="1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1"><a href="#1-Vimeo-On-Demand-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes.

Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option.

Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.</p><p><strong>2. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?</strong></p><p>If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"

If you want to access Vimeo Plus account then pay $59.95&#x2F;year and $9.95&#x2F;month; the feature set is improved with addition of priority support, unlimited channel, albums and groups. Plus account users can avail information about video embed and viewers details. As Vimeo Pro offers so many advanced features like VIO support and advanced stats data so the cost also goes high up to $199&#x2F;year package for 1TB storage space and $399&#x2F;year for 3TB space.</p><h4 id="4-Support-3"><a href="#4-Support-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Support"></a>4. Support</h4><p> If you are using Vimeo basic account then you must expect to get answers for your queries within 3 business days. The Vimeo Plus account users can avail response from support team within 4 hours during business days. The best thing to know about highly advanced Vimeo pro account users is that users can get answers for their queries within one hour and it stays active 24 hours even on weekends.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that basic membership option is great option for beginners but in case if you are in search of priority support service, privacy control, huge storage space, player customization and few other advanced tools then Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro will be more suitable to you. Price range also matters so prefer to pick your software tool as per your budget and needs to have best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-tutorial-customizing-the-final-frame-of-a-vimeo-video/"><u>[New] Ultimate Tutorial  Customizing the Final Frame of a Vimeo Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-best-ios-video-editing-cameo-vs-filmorago/"><u>[Updated] Best iOS Video Editing  Cameo Vs.
