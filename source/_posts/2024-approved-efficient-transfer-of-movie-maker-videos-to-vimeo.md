 As Window Movie Maker creates heavy file sizes with reach video quality so in order to initiate trouble free uploads you may have to compress them using online video compressior [Clipchamp]( https://clipchamp.com/en/video-compressor ). The process is quire easier and you must follow this video for gaining better details about compression process. Here are the basic steps that you need to follow to perform compression:

* Users need to login with their personal account. One can prefer to use Facebook account or sign in with Google account.
* Once you have signed in then upload your video to the timeline and move towards the compression settings. Make all required adjustments.
* Now you can begin the compression process by simply hitting the Compress option available in screen.

#### Step 3: Upload your video to Vimeo

 Before you begin the uploading task, it is essential to know that which media file formats are supported by Vimeo.

* It is time to add some basic description about your video into specified block on Vimeo upload window. Prefer to use some eye catching words to grab attention of viewers.
* Now you have to add tags for your video; it is good to tag it with some commonly searched words so that viewers can find it easily.
* Visit privacy settings on Vimeo platform and choose your audience. There are so many options available for selection as Vimeo provides rich control over privacy.
