### 1\.  More Videos

Once a user has finished watching your video, let him/her enjoy the next! You can easily add three of your public videos to your end screen layout. The videos can be from different sources, including your channel, group, or showcase. On the top, you can even customize your end screen’s background while adding video options!

**Specifications:**

The Vimeo End Screen which embeds at most 3 favorite videos must be more than 375px. If the width is smaller than 375 px, the last video in more videos end screen will not appear.

### 2\.  Call to Action- Direct Users Seamlessly

![Vimeo CTA End Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-call-to-action-end-screen.jpg)

The customizability options for this type of Vimeo End Screen are immense as you can add title, description, and URL as per the need and choice.

### 3\.  Share Options

Enhancing your content’s engagement will require your users to share the videos on social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.

**_Specifications_**:

Currently, users can share the Vimeo video to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or email directly on the end screen.

### 4. Custom Image

To enhance your content’s engagement with your users, you can always display an image after the video ends. You can create custom images yourself. But if you have other things in your mind, such as using a custom image, the clickable link is a good choice too.

**Specifications**

No such specifications are required. You can add any custom image from your desktop or **File Explorer**.

### 5. Thumbnail

Every video contains a thumbnail. So, if you want to end the video with a thumbnail, you can do so by placing it at the end screen.

### 6. Empty
