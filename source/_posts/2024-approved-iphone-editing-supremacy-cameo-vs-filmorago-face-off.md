#### Vimeo Cameo

* Vimeo can be used by iOS users only with a dedicated login account.
* Users can import the camera rolls only to their timeline.
* The editing features in Vimeo are also very limited as compared to Filmora Go as it does not allow one click video editing, transitions, PIP support, motion adjustment features and overlays are also missing here.
* You will not get any watermark on your videos- That is really good.
* It is possible to share videos via Instagram, Email, Facebook, SMS and Twitter.

#### Filmora

* Filmora is available for iOS as well as [Android](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) users without any login.
* Filmora allows users to import camera roll, Google Plus, Instagram as well as facebook collections with ease.
* This software tool has so many advanced features and also covers the missing features of Vimeo Cameo.
* Watermarks are added to videos.
* Videos can be directly shared via Whatsap, Instagram, facebook, Email and Vimeo and YouTube etc.

#### Vimeo Cameo

* Vimeo can be used by iOS users only with a dedicated login account.
* Users can import the camera rolls only to their timeline.
* The editing features in Vimeo are also very limited as compared to Filmora Go as it does not allow one click video editing, transitions, PIP support, motion adjustment features and overlays are also missing here.
* You will not get any watermark on your videos- That is really good.
* It is possible to share videos via Instagram, Email, Facebook, SMS and Twitter.

#### Filmora

* Filmora is available for iOS as well as [Android](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) users without any login.
* Filmora allows users to import camera roll, Google Plus, Instagram as well as facebook collections with ease.
* This software tool has so many advanced features and also covers the missing features of Vimeo Cameo.
* Watermarks are added to videos.
* Videos can be directly shared via Whatsap, Instagram, facebook, Email and Vimeo and YouTube etc.

#### Vimeo Cameo

* Vimeo can be used by iOS users only with a dedicated login account.
* Users can import the camera rolls only to their timeline.
* The editing features in Vimeo are also very limited as compared to Filmora Go as it does not allow one click video editing, transitions, PIP support, motion adjustment features and overlays are also missing here.
* You will not get any watermark on your videos- That is really good.
* It is possible to share videos via Instagram, Email, Facebook, SMS and Twitter.

#### Filmora

* Filmora is available for iOS as well as [Android](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) users without any login.
* Filmora allows users to import camera roll, Google Plus, Instagram as well as facebook collections with ease.
* This software tool has so many advanced features and also covers the missing features of Vimeo Cameo.
* Watermarks are added to videos.
* Videos can be directly shared via Whatsap, Instagram, facebook, Email and Vimeo and YouTube etc.

Also, Filmora provides support to 4K videos that is best advantage for development of tutorials and informative video sessions.
