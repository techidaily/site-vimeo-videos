## **Step 3: Try an External Keyboard**

If you have tried the above methods but they are not helpful, you may need to plug in a USB external keyboard and see if the second keyboard works. 1) If the external keyboard**works perfectly**, then you need to consider searching and downloading the latest version of the laptop driver from HP support.

## **Step 4:** **Perform a Hard Reset**

A hard reset will not remove any of your data in your computer, it is a move that decreases the amount of power stored in hardware components. Please consider following this option when you **cannot log** into your desktop or cannot go to **Advanced Startup Options** panel.  1) Turn off the computer and make sure you have disabled or disconnected all unnecessary external devices. Remove the computer from any port replicator or docking station.  2) Unplug the AC adapter from the computer and remove the battery from the battery compartment. 3) Press and hold the **Power**  button for about 15 seconds to drain any residual electrical charge from the capacitors that protect the memory.  4) Insert the battery and AC adapter back into the laptop, but make sure you don’t connect any external devices just yet. 5) Press **Power** button to turn on the computer.  If the startup menu opens, use the arrow key to select**Start Windows Normally** and press**Enter** key on your keyboard.
