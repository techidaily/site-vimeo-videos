## Part 5: Vimeo Video Chapter Frequently Asked Questions

**_How many chapters can you add to the Vimeo video?_**

Vimeo offers this brilliant feature of adding chapters to videos, but it comes with a limitation. You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.

**_Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?_**

One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.

 **_Why can't I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?_**

If you're a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos. Only the Vimeo Pro, Premium, Business, and Enterprise members can add the chapters to video. Moreover, make sure you're adding less than 100 chapters per video with a title of fewer than 50 characters.

## Part 5: Vimeo Video Chapter Frequently Asked Questions

**_How many chapters can you add to the Vimeo video?_**

Vimeo offers this brilliant feature of adding chapters to videos, but it comes with a limitation. You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.

**_Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?_**

One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.

 **_Why can't I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?_**

If you're a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos. Only the Vimeo Pro, Premium, Business, and Enterprise members can add the chapters to video. Moreover, make sure you're adding less than 100 chapters per video with a title of fewer than 50 characters.
