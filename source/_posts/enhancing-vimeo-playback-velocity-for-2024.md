## FAQs about speeding up Vimeo Video

**1\. Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?**

Yes. It's possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.

**2\. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?**

If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.

## Bonus: How to Enable Speed Control when Uploading Vimeo Video?

Follow these steps to speed up uploaded embedded Vimeo videos.

Step 1: Launch Vimeo and upload video

To upload a new video, move your cursor to the **New Video** button located on the top right corner of your screen and click on the **Upload** button.

Step 2: Edit video settings

## FAQs about speeding up Vimeo Video

**1\. Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?**

Yes. It's possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.

**2\. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?**

If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.
