### Step 4: Choose End Screen Option

You can choose among the various option available in the end screen setting. You can add a custom image, more videos, CTA, and more. The things you need to fill varies based on the end screen type you choose, as we talked about before. Choose the best one suits your need.

### Step 5: Click add and save

Once that option is selected. Click on the ‘’Add’’ button to add a video or custom image per the selected option. Click ‘’save’’ to add the end screen.

## Part 4: How to Change the End Screen on Vimeo Video?

Rather than going on a black screen, you can add the end screen to your Vimeo videos, appearing after your embedded video. If you want to replace the end screen type or the content on the end screen, you can follow the steps below.

Go to the ‘’interaction tool’’ and then click on the ‘’end screen’’ option. You’ll find a ‘’pencil option’’ there. Upon clicking, select the option you would like to select, including video, custom image, CTA, or more. Click on save to save the changes.

## Part 5: How to Create a Powerful End Screen for Vimeo Video?

If you are using the Custom image or thumbnail as the end screen on your Vimeo video, you may need a powerful tool. Thus, we bring you some of the tools to design the powerful end screen for Vimeo videos to interact with your audience.

### · Canva

Canva is one of the best tools to create and design the end screen. You can design a custom image or put animated effects as well.

### · Snappa

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**_Why is Vimeo End Screen not showing?_**

Mostly, it depends on the player. If the player is small than 300 px wide and 169 px in height, the end screen might not appear.

**_Why can’t I add the end screen to the Vimeo video?_**

If you want to add an end screen, you must be a Vimeo Plus, Pro, or Business user.
