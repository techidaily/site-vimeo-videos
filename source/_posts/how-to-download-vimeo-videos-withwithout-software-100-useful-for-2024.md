There might be instances when you wonder how to **download the Vimeo video** you like the most. An honest answer is, there is no simple way to obtain such clips from the streaming platform. And it’s not only the case with Vimeo, but even YouTube and many other similar platforms wouldn’t allow you to download videos that don’t belong to you from their servers due to copyright restrictions.

If you have seen the Download button under the video player, then you can click it to download the Vimeo video directly. But only Vimeo Plus and higher paid members can able the allow downloads option so viewers can download the video directly. So, you can know this by noticing that no online streaming website has the ‘Download’ button. Those which have any such button offer paid subscription, and the downloaded clips are available mostly for mobile platforms, that too merely for a certain time after which the content is automatically removed from your device.

However, there is still a workaround that you can go for to learn **how to download Vimeo videos** on your device.

There might be instances when you wonder how to **download the Vimeo video** you like the most. An honest answer is, there is no simple way to obtain such clips from the streaming platform. And it’s not only the case with Vimeo, but even YouTube and many other similar platforms wouldn’t allow you to download videos that don’t belong to you from their servers due to copyright restrictions.

If you have seen the Download button under the video player, then you can click it to download the Vimeo video directly. But only Vimeo Plus and higher paid members can able the allow downloads option so viewers can download the video directly. So, you can know this by noticing that no online streaming website has the ‘Download’ button. Those which have any such button offer paid subscription, and the downloaded clips are available mostly for mobile platforms, that too merely for a certain time after which the content is automatically removed from your device.
