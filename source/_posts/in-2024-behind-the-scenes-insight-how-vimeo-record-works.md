You can achieve that with the Vimeo Record tool. You don’t need to be concerned about compatibility when you work with Vimeo recorder, as it supports Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. Since virtually all devices can run the Google Chrome browser, pretty much anyone can use the Video Record Chrome extension to record the screen.

The process is not complicated, and even non-tech users can simply run the extension. We introduce you in detail to the screen recording procedure with this great Vimeo recorder.

1. **Install Vimeo Record Extension**

Currently, the Vimeo Record chrome extension works on the Google Chrome browser only. If you don’t already have a Google Chrome browser on your device, install and launch it. After that, download the [Vimeo Record Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimeo-record-screen-webca/ejfmffkmeigkphomnpabpdabfddeadcb?utm%5Fcampaign=screen%5Frecorder&utm%5Fcontent=blog%5Fcta&vcid=38653), and create a new Vimeo account.

1. **Start Recording with Vimeo Recorder**

## Part 2: How to Record Vimeo Video Screens on Mobile?

Android devices, including Android 10, offer [built-in screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here is how to capture the content of your Android mobile screen:

In the Quick Settings menu, launch Screen Recording. Of course, depending on the purpose of your video, you can allow access to mic only, camera only, or both. At the beginning of the process, you will see a short countdown - 3, 2, 1, and the recording starts. Piece of cake!

After you are done performing all the actions on your phone that you want to share on Vimeo, just stop recording and your video will be saved automatically in the cloud. You can download videos to your phone or share them instantly through one or more social media platforms. It’s not hard to stay in touch with all the recordings and get notifications whenever someone views the video and comments.
