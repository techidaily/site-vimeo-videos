There might be instances when you wonder how to **download the Vimeo video** you like the most. An honest answer is, there is no simple way to obtain such clips from the streaming platform. And it’s not only the case with Vimeo, but even YouTube and many other similar platforms wouldn’t allow you to download videos that don’t belong to you from their servers due to copyright restrictions.

If you have seen the Download button under the video player, then you can click it to download the Vimeo video directly. But only Vimeo Plus and higher paid members can able the allow downloads option so viewers can download the video directly. So, you can know this by noticing that no online streaming website has the ‘Download’ button. Those which have any such button offer paid subscription, and the downloaded clips are available mostly for mobile platforms, that too merely for a certain time after which the content is automatically removed from your device.

However, there is still a workaround that you can go for to learn **how to download Vimeo videos** on your device.

If you can read the basic source codes of a web page, this would be a piece of cake for you. On the other hand, those who are not from an IT background may find it challenging to understand all the gibberish characters that the codes a program or website has. Considering this, the following step-by-step instructions would teach **how to download Vimeo videos** without any issues:

### Step 1: Obtain the Embedding Code and Open the Video in Vimeo Player

Go to the Vimeo video that you want to download, click the **Share** icon from the right side of the player window.

![Vimeo Video Player Share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-vimeo-videos-share-button.jpg)

Next, copy the URL of the video with its ID from the embed code. (**Note:** The URL should look something like <https://player.vimeo.come/video/572374008> where the numbers at the end are unique and are different for each video. Make sure to copy the code without double-quotes.). Open a new tab on the Chrome web browser, and paste the URL.

### Step 3: View Page Source and Copy the Video URL

After noting the available resolutions, right-click anywhere inside the video player, and click **View page source** from the context menu. On the next page that opens up, press **Ctrl** \+ **F**, and in the input field, type the resolution of the video, e.g., 1080 for this illustration. Use the **Up** and **Down** icons on the **Search**/**Find** box to locate all the entries with the 1080 number.

![Vimeo Video Player View Page Source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-video-player-view-page-source.jpg)

Here, make sure to look for the code that starts with **{“profile”:123,”width”:1920,….** and has something like **“quality”:1080** in it. In this code, **width:1920** is important as it means that the height will be 1080\. Once you locate this entry, in the same line, copy the URL that starts with <https://vod-progressive>. Ensure to copy the code up till **.mp4**.
