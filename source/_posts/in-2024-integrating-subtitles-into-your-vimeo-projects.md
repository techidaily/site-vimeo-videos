 You can make subtitle or caption yourself or hire a professional video transcription & captioning company to provide a caption file. Such as [3play](http://www.3playmedia.com/services-features/overview/) , [Rev](https://www.rev.com/services) or [Amara](https://amara.org/en/).

 There are numerous file formats to choose from including srt, scc and ttml.

#### Step 2: Upload Caption or Subtitle File to Vimeo

 If you want to add caption or add subtitle to your video then you will first need to know that the compatible format for Vimeo is .vvt/WebVVT.

1. You need to start by logging into your Vimeo account and uploading your chosen video.
