By pressing the information button you are able to find out more about the song, writer, musicians etc.

 Select the track once you have found it by tapping. If you decide you want to try something different or remove it altogether just return to the music menu, select the album and unselect it.

#### 6\. Changing clip audio levels

 If you want to change the level of audio in a specific clip use the edit tool and find the clip you wish to adjust. Keep tapping the audio icon as this will allow you to select whether you want the audio on, off or boosted.

Tap the thumbnail picture once you have found it and confirm by using the red tick.

#### 2\. Add a description

 After you have decided on and saved your thumbnail in the video editor you will be taken back to the page with ‘upload to Vimeo’. Here is where you can add the description at the bottom left of the screen.

 Once you have finished and are ready the video is uploaded automatically as private.
