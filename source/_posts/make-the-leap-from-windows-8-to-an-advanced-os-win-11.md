 Pros

* Amazingly light for the size
* Large, bright screen
* Impressive battery life
* Includes adapter for wired internet

 Cons

* No discrete graphics card
* On the pricey side

 Most people don't usually think of 17-inch laptops as small and lightweight, but that's exactly what the LG Gram 17 manages to accomplish.

 Narrow bezels around its beautiful 2560x1600-pixel display give it the footprint illusion of a 15-inch laptop, and its 2.98-pound weight puts it in a class usually reserved for smaller ultra-portable laptops.

 This model offers a lengthy battery life of 17 hours. Its sharp and vivid display is ideal for watching movies and staying productive. It provides a complete selection of inputs, including a USB-C port, three USB-A ports, an HDMI output, and a microSD card slot.

 The LG Gram 17 does leave off a discrete graphics card to help keep the machine light, making it less equipped for gaming and heavy graphics work. In terms of performance, though, the 1.3GHz 10th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB RAM, and generous 1TB of storage are tough to beat.

 This version also updates the LG Gram 17's design with an improved touchpad and a backlit keyboard that is adjusted to be more comfortable to type on.

**Size:** 15x10.3x0.7 inches |**Screen resolution:** 2560 x 1600 |**Processor:** Intel Core i7-1065G7 |**RAM:** 16GB |**GPU:** None |**Storage:** 1TB SSD

### Operating System

 While adjusting to a new operating system is pretty easy, most people prefer to stick to what they’re familiar with. Windows and Mac operating systems have their merits—Macs are more intuitive and design-friendly, and Windows is more secure and business-savvy—but the choice is personal.

### Processor

 If you need a PC that can handle heavy-duty work, pay close attention to its processor or CPU. AMD’s CPUs tend to be a bit cheaper. Look at the number of cores it has. More cores equal a faster and more efficient processor. Budget models typically have around two, while high-end options can have eight or more.

### Display

 On a 17-inch laptop, displays can be dazzling, with wide-viewing angles and brilliant backlit colors. Depending on your needs, there are touch and non-touch options. Resolution can vary, with the most impressive screens measuring around 1920x1080 pixels.
