## How to add subtitle to Vimeo videos

#### Step 1: Get a Caption/Subtitle File for your Video

 When you create a caption or subtitle you will have to create a text file that gives you sound, transcription and even time stamps for the frames you wish to add them to.

 You can make subtitle or caption yourself or hire a professional video transcription & captioning company to provide a caption file. Such as [3play](http://www.3playmedia.com/services-features/overview/) , [Rev](https://www.rev.com/services) or [Amara](https://amara.org/en/).

 There are numerous file formats to choose from including srt, scc and ttml.

#### Step 2: Upload Caption or Subtitle File to Vimeo

 If you want to add caption or add subtitle to your video then you will first need to know that the compatible format for Vimeo is .vvt/WebVVT.

1. You need to start by logging into your Vimeo account and uploading your chosen video.

5. If you want to add subtitle in numerous languages you will have to continue to repeat the previous step for each.

 Once you have completed your caption and subtitle edits you will need to save your changes and return to your chosen video.

 On the retune you will see at the bottom right of the screen a 'CC' button. This will allow you to turn the captions off and on as well as change the languages the captions and subtitles are displayed in.
