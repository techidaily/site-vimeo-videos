You can achieve that with the Vimeo Record tool. You don’t need to be concerned about compatibility when you work with Vimeo recorder, as it supports Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. Since virtually all devices can run the Google Chrome browser, pretty much anyone can use the Video Record Chrome extension to record the screen.

The process is not complicated, and even non-tech users can simply run the extension. We introduce you in detail to the screen recording procedure with this great Vimeo recorder.

1. **Start Recording with Vimeo Recorder**

If you decide to keep the webcam on, you can drag and drop camera preview to the part on the screen you want to record, and use that camera feed like a mirror to get feedback of your face.

![Vimeo Record Extension Start Recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-record-extenstion-strat-recording-interface.jpg)

Click the **Start recording** button to record. After you start the recording session, you can show your creativity and capture the actions you are taking.
