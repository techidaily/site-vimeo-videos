## Part 4: How to Change the End Screen on Vimeo Video?

Rather than going on a black screen, you can add the end screen to your Vimeo videos, appearing after your embedded video. If you want to replace the end screen type or the content on the end screen, you can follow the steps below.

Go to the ‘’interaction tool’’ and then click on the ‘’end screen’’ option. You’ll find a ‘’pencil option’’ there. Upon clicking, select the option you would like to select, including video, custom image, CTA, or more. Click on save to save the changes.

## Part 5: How to Create a Powerful End Screen for Vimeo Video?
