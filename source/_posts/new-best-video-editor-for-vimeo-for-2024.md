## Free Video Editor for Vimeo

#### **Free Online Video Editor**

#### 1\. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor)

The first of the best video editor for Filmora without having to pay is Kizoa. You are able to cut your video clips, add intros and outros with numerous professional pre made effects and even add a soundtrack to your films and picture slideshows. It’s simple to use and cloud based making it ideal for editing anywhere you have access to the internet, however it does only allow for 10 second videos using a free account, 1GB of data and you will need to download a player should you wish to burn the videos onto DVD. If you only wish to find the best video editor for Filmora for short videos then it’s ideal as you can edit, store, share and access a lot of effects to make your clips look professional. For longer videos another editor would be better suited.

#### 2. [Wevideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

More and more people are using the cloud on the internet from backups to project managing and edits. What can make editors in the cloud difficult to use is the time it can take to upload videos as most people face the upload connections being slower than downloads. With WeVideo you can use cloud based storage which allows for seamless uploading and of course save space on your hard drive.

![how to use wevideo](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/wevideo-add-files.jpg)

You can use your mobile devices and PC’s to upload your videos automatically to the cloud. You will then be able to drag them into the editor without delay and best of all, easily. It’s so easy to edit your videos with WeVideo whether you want to trim or add transitions. There are also lots of soundtracks for you to add to your videos and you can even fade the audio in and out for a professional effect. You can even get friends to upload their videos if you wish and add them to your own footage making collaboration easy.

As a free user you will only be able to export 480p videos and they are watermarked. This is unfortunately not upfront and only shows once you have completed your edit. It is however easy enough to connect to the most popular video services making it easier to share.

#### **Free Video Editor for PC**

On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose. When looking for a free editor be aware than many free versions have limitations which is why we have listed our favourites below.

#### 1\. [Windows Movie Maker](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/store/p/movie-maker-free-video-editor/9nblggh4wwjr)

One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit

![ Video Editing -1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wlmm-vs-wmm-2.jpg)

#### 2\. [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/)

Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.

![free mp4 video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/lightworks.jpg)

#### **Free Video Editor for Mac**

If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:

#### 1\. [Shotcut](https://www.shotcutapp.com/)

Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.

![linux adobe premiere alternative](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png "linux adobe premiere alternative")

#### 2. [Avidemux](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/)

The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful. It’s simple to use but it can take a while to get used to the layout which could put off someone who is new to editing altogether. You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.

Magisto is aimed at novices to give them a way to create videos that look professional by either turning a few stills into a slideshow to music or altering a video. It’s fun and easy to use, so much so that it has been used in many classroom projects thanks to the automated video production functions. The free version is more of a way to give you a demonstration than being a standalone free editor and you do have to pay the subscription price to be able to access more functions as the production lengths are limited. The automated editing can be off-putting for those looking for the best video editor for Vimeo above a novice level due to the automation, but is perfect for those just finding their feet.

#### 3. Quik by GoPro ([iOS](<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stupeflix.replay&hl> /) /[ iOS ](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/quik-gopro-video-editor-make-quick-music-edits/id694164275?mt=8) ）

One of the best video editor for Vimeo is Quick by GoPro thanks to the fact it has been created to work well for those that want a fast way to edit yet have professionalism in the final cuts. It’s not difficult to set up but it does require 112MB of space and QuickTime to function. For people with a slow connection to the internet or little space on their hard drive this could prove problematic. For new users there is a tutorial to help them find their way around and lots of control over editing including exposure and white balance. There are also numerous pre-set filters to get a professional look whether it’s your first or 1000th time of video editing. Although a great product it does still have a few bugs that need ironing out including the fact that it can crash for seemingly no reason. Aside from this there are numerous functions that would rival quite a few paid editors.

#### **Free Video Editor for PC**

On your search for the best video editor for Filmora for PC without paying for software you will more than likely come across a number of different types of software and be a loss as to which one to choose. When looking for a free editor be aware than many free versions have limitations which is why we have listed our favourites below.

#### 1\. [Windows Movie Maker](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/store/p/movie-maker-free-video-editor/9nblggh4wwjr)

One of the best ways to find the best video editor for Filmora is to find one that is first of all easy to use and secondly has a range of features to help make your video stand out. Windows Move Maker has a lot of great sharing options, is simple to use and you have numerous transitions to choose from. You are able to automatically preview the effects you wish to apply before finalising and you can also add voiceover or other audio such as a soundtrack to suit your video. Unfortunately what does let the Windows Movie Maker down is the fact that you can’t adjust the effects which limits you if you want to make it your own. There’s no way to adjust the saturation or contrast either which could be problematic for some users who need this option. The Windows Movie Maker is a great option if you are new to video editing as it is among the easiest to use to combine and edit

#### 2\. [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/)

Lightworks made our list of best video editor for Filmora because it has a free option and can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Users are able to try out the free version and upgrade if they wish to access more functions and it is able to support professional level edits so it can grow with you. The Lightworks editor was designed by professionals yet has been created for ease of use for people without the expertise to use a more complex software. With the latest release of Lightworks the professional version has increased in price and is no longer subscription based but for one off payments only. This can put it out of the reach of people that only use it occasionally. There’s no extra help and the hints are pretty basic so those that are not used to editing may struggle to use Lightworks. There are also only a few effects that can be used for editing audio which might be off-putting.

#### **Free Video Editor for Mac**

If you are looking for the best video editor for Vimeo and have a Mac device then you have a couple of options. They are as follows:

#### 1\. [Shotcut](https://www.shotcutapp.com/)

Shotcut has a lot of support for numerous formats of audio and video formats and is constantly being developed to add new features to the list. There are a lot of video filters which is great for those that want a professional video without having the expertise. Shotcut can be used on Linux, Windows and Mac devices making it versatile and you don’t have to import media as it has native editing capabilities. There is the option to customise the filters to suit your needs rather than having to settle for just the template settings. Unfortunately, still being in development there are a few bugs that need fixing including the fact that it can crash occasionally, although this has been improved with the latest updates. For this reason it’s important to save the project as you go so you don’t lose your editing work. There’s no filter for keyframe at the moment, however this is something they will be adding in the future.

![linux adobe premiere alternative](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/shotcut.png "linux adobe premiere alternative")

#### 2. [Avidemux](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/)

The reason why Avidemux is one of the best video editor for Vimeo is the fact that it is so powerful.

You can however create videos that look professional in seconds once you learn how to use it, exchange the format and much more. Users have access to a lot of filters, options for decoding and customise scripts, but learn bit by bit to avoid getting error messages from straying too far from the default settings. If you want a powerful editor that gives you more options than many others then Avidemux is a great choice, but don’t forget to learn the menu and familiarise yourself with the software to avoid errors later down the line.

The free version is more of a way to give you a demonstration than being a standalone free editor and you do have to pay the subscription price to be able to access more functions as the production lengths are limited. The automated editing can be off-putting for those looking for the best video editor for Vimeo above a novice level due to the automation, but is perfect for those just finding their feet.

#### 3. Quik by GoPro ([iOS](<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stupeflix.replay&hl> /) /[ iOS ](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/quik-gopro-video-editor-make-quick-music-edits/id694164275?mt=8) ）

One of the best video editor for Vimeo is Quick by GoPro thanks to the fact it has been created to work well for those that want a fast way to edit yet have professionalism in the final cuts. It’s not difficult to set up but it does require 112MB of space and QuickTime to function. For people with a slow connection to the internet or little space on their hard drive this could prove problematic. For new users there is a tutorial to help them find their way around and lots of control over editing including exposure and white balance. There are also numerous pre-set filters to get a professional look whether it’s your first or 1000th time of video editing. Although a great product it does still have a few bugs that need ironing out including the fact that it can crash for seemingly no reason. Aside from this there are numerous functions that would rival quite a few paid editors.
