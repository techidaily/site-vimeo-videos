Almost every Windows and Mac device has a built-in screen recorder, and those are typically quite solid and fairly easy to use. Still, at times may be necessary to go beyond the built-in tool frameworks, and infuse your work with exceptional professionalism.

You can achieve that with the Vimeo Record tool. You don’t need to be concerned about compatibility when you work with Vimeo recorder, as it supports Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. Since virtually all devices can run the Google Chrome browser, pretty much anyone can use the Video Record Chrome extension to record the screen.

The process is not complicated, and even non-tech users can simply run the extension. We introduce you in detail to the screen recording procedure with this great Vimeo recorder.

1. **Install Vimeo Record Extension**

Currently, the Vimeo Record chrome extension works on the Google Chrome browser only. If you don’t already have a Google Chrome browser on your device, install and launch it. After that, download the [Vimeo Record Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimeo-record-screen-webca/ejfmffkmeigkphomnpabpdabfddeadcb?utm%5Fcampaign=screen%5Frecorder&utm%5Fcontent=blog%5Fcta&vcid=38653), and create a new Vimeo account.

1. **Start Recording with Vimeo Recorder**

Click the Vimeo Record icon in the extension toolbar, and then decide to record the full screen or current tab screen, or record the camera to include footage of yourself in the video or both. If you decide to keep the webcam on, you can drag and drop camera preview to the part on the screen you want to record, and use that camera feed like a mirror to get feedback of your face.

Click the **Start recording** button to record. After you start the recording session, you can show your creativity and capture the actions you are taking.

1. **Stop recording with Vimeo Recorder and share**

When you decide to stop recording, find the Stop sharing button at the bottom of your screen. Click on it, and save the video.

## Part 2: How to Record Vimeo Video Screens on Mobile?

As we said before, the Vimeo Record tool is currently available as a Chrome extension, and there is no app of Vimeo Record for iPhone or Android devices. But if you want to record the Vimeo video screen on mobile, you can do that.

Android devices, including Android 10, offer [built-in screen recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Here is how to capture the content of your Android mobile screen:

In the Quick Settings menu, launch Screen Recording. Of course, depending on the purpose of your video, you can allow access to mic only, camera only, or both. At the beginning of the process, you will see a short countdown - 3, 2, 1, and the recording starts. Piece of cake!

After you are done performing all the actions on your phone that you want to share on Vimeo, just stop recording and your video will be saved automatically in the cloud. You can download videos to your phone or share them instantly through one or more social media platforms. It’s not hard to stay in touch with all the recordings and get notifications whenever someone views the video and comments. Using this approach for business will put you in a better position in the market and stimulate engagement with the customers.

If you are using the iOS devices, you can record the Vimeo video screen with the in-built screen recorder feature if your iPhone is running iOS 11 and later versions. We have written an article about [how to record iPhone/iPad’s screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in detail, you can find all the information needed.

**Quick Fix: Why I Can’t Use Vimeo Recorder on My Mac Computer?**

After installing the Vimeo screen recorder, Mac users sometimes need to perform a few preparatory steps to allow the extension to launch. Open System Preferences, and click the Security & Privacy icon. Scroll to Screen Recording, and allow Google Chrome access to the content of the screen.

Of course, at this point, you’ll also have to grant permission to access your camera and microphone. Once you activate all the necessary options, restart Chrome and full range of screen capturing tools will be at your disposal.
