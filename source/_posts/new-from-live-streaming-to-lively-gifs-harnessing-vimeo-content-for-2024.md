**Conclusion**

GIFs are fun, so is creating one. You just need the right tools to make it. No longer do you have to be a Photoshop pro to create a Vimeo gif. Tools like Vimeo and other [gif makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are designed to make it easy for all.

All these tools have a three-step approach – upload the video, choose the time frame, and create. That’s it! It’s that simple.
