## How to add subtitle to Vimeo videos

#### Step 1: Get a Caption/Subtitle File for your Video

 When you create a caption or subtitle you will have to create a text file that gives you sound, transcription and even time stamps for the frames you wish to add them to.

 You can make subtitle or caption yourself or hire a professional video transcription & captioning company to provide a caption file. Such as [3play](http://www.3playmedia.com/services-features/overview/) , [Rev](https://www.rev.com/services) or [Amara](https://amara.org/en/).

 There are numerous file formats to choose from including srt, scc and ttml.

#### Step 2: Upload Caption or Subtitle File to Vimeo

 If you want to add caption or add subtitle to your video then you will first need to know that the compatible format for Vimeo is .vvt/WebVVT.

1. You need to start by logging into your Vimeo account and uploading your chosen video.

#### How to Add Text/Subtitles/Credits to Vimeo Videos with Filmora Video Editor

 After dragging-n-dropping your Vimeo video to the timeline, click the “Text/Credit” tab on the Tool bar, then you will see there are many preset templates available. Click the designed template and then drag it to the Text track in the timeline.

 Double click the Text/Credit template in the Text track and edit it further in the Advanced Text Edit window. You can change the color, size, font, effects, duration and opacity depending on your requirements. You can also save the edited Text as a preset so you can use it directly in the next time.
