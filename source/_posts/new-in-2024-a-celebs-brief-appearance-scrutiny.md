 More and more people are using mobile technology on the go, which is why Vimeo have introduced [Vimeo Cameo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cameo-video-editor-and-movie-maker/id988821661?mt=8). It is basically an app that can be used by your iOS device to upload, as a video editor and professionally adapt with different styles and effects. Once the video is complete then you are able to upload it straight from your mobile device to the Vimeo site.

## Editing features

 Once you have downloaded the Vimeo Cameo you just have to log in if you have an existing account or create one. Once logged in just tap to create a new video and make sure you allow the Vimeo Cameo to access the camera roll. The videos save as drafts as you go so you don’t have to worry about stopping for a while. To start a new project tap the ‘+‘ button to add any video clips from your roll. They will play automatically from the timeline once they have been uploaded.

#### 1\. Trimming clips

![cameo-trimming-clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-trimming-clips.jpg)

 If you want to trim any clips you can do so by selecting the icon that looks like a pair of scissors. Just use the white dots that are located at the bottom of your screen so that you can create a different start or end point.

#### 2\. Changing clip order

 If you would like your clips to be in a different order all you have to do is tap and keep your finger on the clip. Once you do this you will see the timeline pop up, which allows you to drag the clips to their new location.

#### 3\. Deleting and Replicating clips

 If you want to copy or delete a clip in the video editor then just tap and hold in the same way as you did to change the order. You will then be given an option to duplicate or delete by either puling the clip up or down.

#### 4\. Add or change the theme

![cameo-themes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-themes.jpg)
