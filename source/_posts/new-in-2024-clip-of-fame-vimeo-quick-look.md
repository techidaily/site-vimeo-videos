## Advanced editing

#### 1\. Add a title and thumbnail

![title-and-thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/title-and-thumbnail.jpg)

 Once you have finished with the Vimeo cameo video editor you can then select a thumbnail and title to add. Start with the upload to Vimeo part and select add a title. Choose the title you want to give to your video and you will be automatically be prompted to choose a thumbnail photograph. You can do this from a frame of your video by using the selection bar. Tap the thumbnail picture once you have found it and confirm by using the red tick.

#### 2\. Add a description

 After you have decided on and saved your thumbnail in the video editor you will be taken back to the page with ‘upload to Vimeo’. Here is where you can add the description at the bottom left of the screen.

## Sharing features

 Once you have finished and are ready the video is uploaded automatically as private. You can specify otherwise if you are sure you have completed editing by toggling to make it public by tapping on the button in the lower right marked privacy. Select done and the video will upload automatically to your account. Use the video settings to add more privacy options by selecting settings and making adjustments in your privacy tab.

## Summary

 Vimeo Cameo allows you to use your mobile device as a video editor by accessing the videos you already have in your camera roll. You don’t have to hook your phone up to a PC or laptop as the videos can be uploaded and edited directly from the device making it easier than ever to have more control over your videos when you are on the move.
