 To add any music to videos just use the music icon. This lets you select tracks from the library. To go through the tracks just swipe first across and up or down. You can also use the categories to make it easier to locate the music you want by genre. You can preview the songs by selecting the cover of the album and use the little play bar. By pressing the information button you are able to find out more about the song, writer, musicians etc.

 Select the track once you have found it by tapping. If you decide you want to try something different or remove it altogether just return to the music menu, select the album and unselect it.

#### 6\. Changing clip audio levels

 If you want to change the level of audio in a specific clip use the edit tool and find the clip you wish to adjust. Keep tapping the audio icon as this will allow you to select whether you want the audio on, off or boosted.
