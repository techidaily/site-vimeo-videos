 Vimeo Cameo allows you to use your mobile device as a video editor by accessing the videos you already have in your camera roll. You don’t have to hook your phone up to a PC or laptop as the videos can be uploaded and edited directly from the device making it easier than ever to have more control over your videos when you are on the move.
