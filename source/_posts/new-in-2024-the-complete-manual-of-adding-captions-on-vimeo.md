 Once you have completed your caption and subtitle edits you will need to save your changes and return to your chosen video.

 On the retune you will see at the bottom right of the screen a 'CC' button. This will allow you to turn the captions off and on as well as change the languages the captions and subtitles are displayed in.

#### How to Add Text/Subtitles/Credits to Vimeo Videos with Filmora Video Editor

 After dragging-n-dropping your Vimeo video to the timeline, click the “Text/Credit” tab on the Tool bar, then you will see there are many preset templates available. Click the designed template and then drag it to the Text track in the timeline.

 Double click the Text/Credit template in the Text track and edit it further in the Advanced Text Edit window. You can change the color, size, font, effects, duration and opacity depending on your requirements. You can also save the edited Text as a preset so you can use it directly in the next time.
