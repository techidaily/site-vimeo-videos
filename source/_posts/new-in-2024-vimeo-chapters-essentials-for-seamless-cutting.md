## Part 5: Vimeo Video Chapter Frequently Asked Questions

**_How many chapters can you add to the Vimeo video?_**

Vimeo offers this brilliant feature of adding chapters to videos, but it comes with a limitation. You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.

**_Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?_**

One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.

 **_Why can't I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?_**

If you're a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos. Only the Vimeo Pro, Premium, Business, and Enterprise members can add the chapters to video. Moreover, make sure you're adding less than 100 chapters per video with a title of fewer than 50 characters.

## Part 4: Why Should You Add Chapters to Vimeo Video?

Adding chapters to Vimeo videos serves the users with plenty of benefits. The users and the creators will have more engagement of the content and a better exposure overall. Here are some both way benefits

### 1. Gather Useful Information Effortlessly

You might be struggling across the video progress bar to find your favorite section. Not anymore now! With this amazing option to add chapters to a Vimeo video, the user will be able to gather useful information in a breeze. Moreover, the long-form video can easily be digested as the user will find the organized content more appealing.

### 2. Chapter Markers

Vimeo Chapter markers will help users get rid of the messy content! These markers highlight your video's key moments, making it seamless for the audience to grasp what they want!

### 3. Video Segmenting

Long videos might be boring to watch, and the audience will not be able to digest all the facts stated in the video. Video segmenting is a sure way to make the long-form video short and interact- that's what adding chapters do!

### 4. Engagement Analysis

Vimeo offers you the analytics of each video to look at how well your content is engaging your audience! Within the video, chapter markers help creators have an insight into the individual analytics for a Vimeo chapter. This way, a video creator can know which section of the video is more engaging for the specific audience of his/her channel.

## Part 5: Vimeo Video Chapter Frequently Asked Questions

**_How many chapters can you add to the Vimeo video?_**

Vimeo offers this brilliant feature of adding chapters to videos, but it comes with a limitation. You can add only 100 chapters per video. You can try splitting your videos in 2 parts and upload separately to add more than 100 chapters on each video.

**_Why are Vimeo chapters not showing?_**

One common reason why Vimeo video chapters are not showing is that the chapter only appears in your embedded videos. You cannot view any chapter in your video using the on-site interface on Vimeo. Creators can see the chapters list in their dashboard under the ‘’chapters’’ heading with the title and starting time. Users can see the chapters on the embedded video with the ‘’dots’’ in the progress bar.

 **_Why can't I add a chapter to the Vimeo video?_**

If you're a basic user of Vimeo, you cannot add a chapter to videos. Only the Vimeo Pro, Premium, Business, and Enterprise members can add the chapters to video. Moreover, make sure you're adding less than 100 chapters per video with a title of fewer than 50 characters.
