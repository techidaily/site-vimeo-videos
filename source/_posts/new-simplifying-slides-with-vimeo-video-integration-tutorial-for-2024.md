Now you are all done and your video is there on your PowerPoint presentation.

## How to embedding Vimeo videos to PowerPoint

It’s easy to enrich your presentation with a video from Vimeo, a popular video hosting site. You can either add a video you have created and uploaded to Vimeo yourself, or use a video created by others as long as its owner has not disabled embedding.

Here’s the tutorial on how to embed a Vimeo video in your PowerPoint presentation.

**Step 1:** First you need to open the Vimeo video you wish to add to your presentation. Now hit the ‘Share’ button which resembles the paper plane icon. A window will pop up.

![vimeo-share-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-share-video.jpg)

The text under the ‘Embed’ section has to be copied and pasted onto Notepad or MS Word.

**Step 2:**  The copied text which looks like a code is going to be a long one. Now just copy the bold section of the text.

![vimeo-sharing-code](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-sharing-code.jpg)

**Step 3:** Open the PowerPoint presentation and click “Insert” and then choose the down arrow below the video icon. You will have three choices which are: video from file, video from website and clipart video. Choose video from website.

![insert-vimeo-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-vimeo-video.jpg)

**Step 4:**  Paste the embedded code and then click “Insert”.

## How to embedding Vimeo videos to PowerPoint

It’s easy to enrich your presentation with a video from Vimeo, a popular video hosting site. You can either add a video you have created and uploaded to Vimeo yourself, or use a video created by others as long as its owner has not disabled embedding.

Here’s the tutorial on how to embed a Vimeo video in your PowerPoint presentation.

**Step 1:** First you need to open the Vimeo video you wish to add to your presentation. Now hit the ‘Share’ button which resembles the paper plane icon. A window will pop up.

The text under the ‘Embed’ section has to be copied and pasted onto Notepad or MS Word.

**Step 2:**  The copied text which looks like a code is going to be a long one. Now just copy the bold section of the text.

**Step 3:** Open the PowerPoint presentation and click “Insert” and then choose the down arrow below the video icon. You will have three choices which are: video from file, video from website and clipart video. Choose video from website.
