## FAQs about speeding up Vimeo Video

**1\. Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?**

Yes. It's possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.

**2\. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?**

If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.

If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.

## Part 1: How to Speed Up Video Playback When Watching Videos on Vimeo?

Increasing video playback speed when watching videos on Vimeo would require you to use the Vimeo speed control built-in feature. There are two approaches to this method even though they are almost similar. Are you the owner of the videos and do you want to speed up video playback when watching the video on Vimeo?

Vimeo offers its users the latitude to watch videos at six different speeds as illustrated below.

* 5X - 0.5 times slower than the normal speed
* 75X - 0.75 times slower than the normal speed
* Normal speed
* 25X - 1.25 times faster than the normal speed
* 5X - 1.5 times faster than the normal speed
* 2X - 2 times faster than the normal speed

Here are the steps:

Step 1: Launch Vimeo on your desktop and select video

 After launching Vimeo, click on the **Video** button located on the left side. From your video list, select the video you want to watch and click to play.

## Part 2: How to Speed Up Vimeo Videos Using Chrome Extension?

Whereas videos speed up chrome extensions are numerous, Vimeo has its own **Vimeo repeat and speed** chrome extension. After installing this Chrome extension from your desktop, two features are automatically added to the Vimeo app – **Repeat** and **Playback Rate**.

Remember, not all Vimeo videos will have the speed control displayed by default. If the embed presets is disabled, you’ll have to enable the Speed controls option to see the speed options.

This is how to speed up Vimeo videos using Vimeo repeat and speed chrome extension:

Step 1: Install the Vimeo repeat and speed extension

On your desktop, open **Vimeo repeat and speed**, then click the **Add to Chrome** button to install the chrome extension to the Vimeo's HTML5 video player.
