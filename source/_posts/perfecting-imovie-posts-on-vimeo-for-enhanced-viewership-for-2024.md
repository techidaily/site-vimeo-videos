## Part 2: How to Compress the Video

When trying to upload iMovie videos to Vimeo, many people may get a pop up telling them the file is too big. Don’t dismay as compressing the video will allow you to upload without additional problems.

**Step 1:** Find the export settings in your program, generally under “File – Export”, “File – Share”, or “Save As”.

**Step 2:** Select “File” and save the video to Mac.

**Step 3:**  Compress the video.

An alternative to the aforementioned compression method is to use **Compressor**. Before you can do anything, you need to set up an account first or use an existing Facebook or Google account to do so.

One of the most popular tools that can significantly shrink the file size without losing quality is [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-compresso).

Follow this instruction to compress your videos without sacrificing the quality.

**Step 1:** Upload your video and set it to compress.

**Step 2:** Press **Start** to begin compressing.

**Step 3:** Then share the video directly to Vimeo.

![clipchamp-compress](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-compress.jpg)

As you can see, using the Clipchamp compressor to compress before you upload iMovie videos to Vimeo is a simpler, faster way to do. It's great for people who are new to video making, editing, and uploading. For those with more skill, reducing the steps is an excellent way to save time and get videos up faster.
