#### How to Add Text/Subtitles/Credits to Vimeo Videos with Filmora Video Editor

 After dragging-n-dropping your Vimeo video to the timeline, click the “Text/Credit” tab on the Tool bar, then you will see there are many preset templates available. Click the designed template and then drag it to the Text track in the timeline.

 Double click the Text/Credit template in the Text track and edit it further in the Advanced Text Edit window. You can change the color, size, font, effects, duration and opacity depending on your requirements. You can also save the edited Text as a preset so you can use it directly in the next time.
