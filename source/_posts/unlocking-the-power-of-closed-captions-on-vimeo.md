 Once you have completed your caption and subtitle edits you will need to save your changes and return to your chosen video.

 On the retune you will see at the bottom right of the screen a 'CC' button. This will allow you to turn the captions off and on as well as change the languages the captions and subtitles are displayed in.

 Double click the Text/Credit template in the Text track and edit it further in the Advanced Text Edit window.
