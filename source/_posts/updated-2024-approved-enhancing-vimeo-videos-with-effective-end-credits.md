## Part 1: What is the End Screen in Vimeo?

End Screen is what appears in your video during the last 5-10 seconds. These are considered the best option to leave an excellent impression on your audience to increase your connection with them and enhance the engagement of your content. You can add multiple things, overlays, and pictures to your end screen as per your choice.

Vimeo Plus and higher members can enjoy using this end screen feature and let your audience know where to head next! As the universal rule implies here, ‘’the more customization, the more engagement’’, thus here are some of the customizable options for your Vimeo End Screens that states what you can add to the end screens and why. Let’s delve into the details.

![Vimeo More Videos End Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-video-end-screen-options.jpg)

### 1\.  More Videos

Once a user has finished watching your video, let him/her enjoy the next! You can easily add three of your public videos to your end screen layout. The videos can be from different sources, including your channel, group, or showcase. On the top, you can even customize your end screen’s background while adding video options!

**Specifications:**

The Vimeo End Screen which embeds at most 3 favorite videos must be more than 375px. If the width is smaller than 375 px, the last video in more videos end screen will not appear.

### 2\.  Call to Action- Direct Users Seamlessly

![Vimeo CTA End Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-call-to-action-end-screen.jpg)

You can urge users to perform a specific action using this type of Vimeo End screen. The call-to-action buttons can be added, which can contain multiple phrases or actions. For example, you can add a custom link to share and ask users to click on the ‘’xxx’’ button to direct them to a specific video or site, or product page. The customizability options for this type of Vimeo End Screen are immense as you can add title, description, and URL as per the need and choice.

### 3\.  Share Options

![Vimeo Share on Social  End Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-share-options-end-screen.jpg)

Enhancing your content’s engagement will require your users to share the videos on social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. You can add multiple share icons at the end screen for your social media platforms. At the end screen containing video URL or social share icons, you can change the background as per your choice.

**_Specifications_**:

Currently, users can share the Vimeo video to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or email directly on the end screen.

### 4. Custom Image

To enhance your content’s engagement with your users, you can always display an image after the video ends. You can create custom images yourself. But if you have other things in your mind, such as using a custom image, the clickable link is a good choice too.

**Specifications**

No such specifications are required. You can add any custom image from your desktop or **File Explorer**.

### 5. Thumbnail

Every video contains a thumbnail. So, if you want to end the video with a thumbnail, you can do so by placing it at the end screen.

### 6. Empty

If you want your video to show nothing at the end of the video, you can do so by showing nothing at the end screen.

### 7. Text

The majority may overlook this, but you can always add text to your Vimeo end screen. Users generally leave type a text that says, “Thank you for watching the video. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and share the video.”

## Part 2: Why Should You Add An End Screen to Vimeo Video?

There are plenty of reasons why one should opt to add the end screens to your Vimeo video, as these end screens are considered a powerful tool to engage users in your content. Mainly there are four primary reasons to add the end screens to your Vimeo videos.

* Pointing towards your existing content
* Call for sharing and more engagement
* Promotion of a website
* Fundraising event support

Apart from these above-stated reasons, professionals have found that the end screens can do even more for you as a content creator. Here are some of the additional benefits of adding end screens to Vimeo Videos:

### 1\. Video Promotion

Your existing videos are a source of immense engagement for your channel, especially when a new user sees any of your videos. You can add the URLs to your three Vimeo videos related to your current video or redirect users to watch the series (e.g., part 1, part 2, etc.). This way, you can promote your existing content to get more views and get fruitful results.

### 2\. Branding in your niche

A content creator must take on the branding opportunities. The end screen lets the Vimeo Creators add links to their third-party websites or promote any product.
