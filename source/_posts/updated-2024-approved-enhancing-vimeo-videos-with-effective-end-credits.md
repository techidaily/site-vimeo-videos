### 1\. Video Promotion

Your existing videos are a source of immense engagement for your channel, especially when a new user sees any of your videos. You can add the URLs to your three Vimeo videos related to your current video or redirect users to watch the series (e.g., part 1, part 2, etc.). This way, you can promote your existing content to get more views and get fruitful results.

### 2\. Branding in your niche

A content creator must take on the branding opportunities. The end screen lets the Vimeo Creators add links to their third-party websites or promote any product.
