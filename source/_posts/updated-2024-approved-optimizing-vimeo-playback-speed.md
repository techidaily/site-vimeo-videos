## Part 4: How to Get More Speed Up Options for Vimeo Video?

## FAQs about speeding up Vimeo Video

**1\. Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?**

Yes. It's possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.

**2\. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?**

If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.

Step 2: Open the Vimeo app and choose the video to speed up.

Step 3: Input playback rate.

Other than the default features, two features will be displayed – **REPEAT and Playback rate.** Click on the Playback rate button and input the playback rate (speed) you need in the box that pops up. Click to play the video.

As illustrated in the screenshot, the maximum speed up rate was 16X faster than the normal speed.

## Part 3: How to Speed Up Vimeo Videos Using the Dev Tools for free?

Web development tools (DevTools) are sets of web authoring and debugging tools built into every modern web browser. With devtools, you can speed up Vimeo videos for free whether using Mac or Windows operating system.

Here are the steps to follow:

Step 1: Launch the Vimeo app and log into your account.

Step 2: Open the Vimeo video you’d like to speed up.

Step 3: Open the dev tools

The best and fastest way to open dev tools is by using keyboard shortcuts.

If you’re a Chrome OS, Linux, or Windows user, press t Control + Shift + J and a Console panel will open on the right side of the video. And if you’re using Mac, press Command + Option + J.

In the Inspect element, edit the last digit shown in the playback rate section and you’ll adjust the Vimeo playback speed. Now click to play your video.

## Part 4: How to Get More Speed Up Options for Vimeo Video?

As clearly shown in part 1, the Vimeo app limits speeding up videos up to 2 times faster than its normal speed. For you to speed up a Vimeo video up to 10X its normal speed, Wondershare Filmora be would the ideal software to use. This software is compatible with both Windows 7/8/10 and mac OS.

If you want to get more speed up options for Vimeo videos, here are the steps to follow:

On Vimeo, click the three buttons below the video description and tap the **Download** button. Choose your desired resolution from the options in the pop-up window and click **download**, and then save your video.

## Bonus: How to Enable Speed Control when Uploading Vimeo Video?

When uploading a Vimeo video, the speed controls are usually hidden making it impossible to speed up the video.

To access the speed controls, open the uploaded Vimeo video from the video manager section.

Follow these steps to speed up uploaded embedded Vimeo videos.

Step 1: Launch Vimeo and upload video

To upload a new video, move your cursor to the **New Video** button located on the top right corner of your screen and click on the **Upload** button.

Step 2: Edit video settings

Tap on the video settings icon shown on the screenshot below.

Step 3: Speed up your video

Enable the video controls under the Embed section, then click on the gear icon below the video. Then select either 1.25x, 1.5x or 1.5x speed option.

## FAQs about speeding up Vimeo Video

**1\. Can you speed up the Vimeo video on iPhone and Android phones?**

Yes. It's possible to speed up Vimeo videos using the built-in speed control feature when open with the browsers.

**2\. Why can’t I speed up Vimeo videos sometimes?**

If you can’t see the speed controls in the Vimeo media player, it means that the video may have been embedded with the Speed Controls option. The speed control option is only accessible to paid Vimeo users, i.e. PRO, Business, or Premium account.

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for the easiest method to speed up Vimeo videos, I recommend using Vimeo’s speed control. But to speed up your Vimeo videos to any speed above the app’s maximum 2x speed and enhance the quality of the video, Wondershare Filmora would be the best tool to use.
