The types of videos chosen as Staff Picks are wide ranging – music videos, animations, documentaries, branded content.

## Tips for developing Vimeo Staff Picked Videos

#### 1.Video Story

Vimeo Staff Picks not only deals with classic editing and appealing visuals but it focuses on solid story of your content. Never forget to add some interesting characters in the beginning, middle and end. Make it narrative if possible and try to combine various dynamic elements for great results.
