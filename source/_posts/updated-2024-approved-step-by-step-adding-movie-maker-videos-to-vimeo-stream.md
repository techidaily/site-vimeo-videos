The process is quire easier and you must follow this video for gaining better details about compression process. Here are the basic steps that you need to follow to perform compression:

* Users need to login with their personal account. One can prefer to use Facebook account or sign in with Google account.
* Once you have signed in then upload your video to the timeline and move towards the compression settings. Make all required adjustments.
