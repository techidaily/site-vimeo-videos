Once that option is selected. Click on the ‘’Add’’ button to add a video or custom image per the selected option. Click ‘’save’’ to add the end screen.

## Part 4: How to Change the End Screen on Vimeo Video?

Rather than going on a black screen, you can add the end screen to your Vimeo videos, appearing after your embedded video. If you want to replace the end screen type or the content on the end screen, you can follow the steps below.

Go to the ‘’interaction tool’’ and then click on the ‘’end screen’’ option. You’ll find a ‘’pencil option’’ there. Upon clicking, select the option you would like to select, including video, custom image, CTA, or more. Click on save to save the changes.

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**_Why is Vimeo End Screen not showing?_**

Mostly, it depends on the player. If the player is small than 300 px wide and 169 px in height, the end screen might not appear.

**_Why can’t I add the end screen to the Vimeo video?_**

If you want to add an end screen, you must be a Vimeo Plus, Pro, or Business user.
