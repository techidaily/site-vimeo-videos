* [How to share Vimeo videos on Social Networks](#part1)
* [How to share Vimeo video via Email](#part2)
* [How to embed a Vimeo video](#part3)

## How to share Vimeo videos on Social Networks

Before using the share video option the first thing you have to do is hit the ‘share’ button on the chosen Vimeo video. You will find this button (the paper airplane icon) on the top right of the video. Click on it to view the share options.

![vimeo-share-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-share-video.jpg)

You will be able to share the Vimeo video on a number of social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, Pinterest and Google +. All you need to do is click on any of the social media buttons and then log in to your social media profile.

## How to share Vimeo video via Email

For sharing the Vimeo video via email you need to enter the name or the email id of the people with whom you want to share. If the person’s name is recognized by Vimeo then you will be able to view her/his profile pic and name.

![vimeo-email-address](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-email-address.jpg)

Now select the people you want to share the video with by hitting their profile pic. After each selection a blue tick is going to appear beside their name. The video link can also be accompanied by a message. After confirming that you aren’t a robot you need to hit the send button.

**Step 1:** Hit the share button which is to be found below the video.

![vimeo-sharing-code](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-sharing-code.jpg)

**Step 3:** In the final step you need to paste the Embed code you just copied onto your webpage.

It needs to be mentioned here that the publisher of the video might choose to restrict the sites where the video can be embedded. In case there are such restrictions on your chosen video then you will not be able to share it on your website. Vimeo videos which have such restrictions will show a message just below the video which explains where it can be placed.

Now that you know all about sharing the Vimeo video you are all set to share your favourite videos with your friends and followers.
