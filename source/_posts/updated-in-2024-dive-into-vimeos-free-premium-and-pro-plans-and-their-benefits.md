 Market is loaded with the software that can assist users in video hosting needs. You can even get many interesting features with free tools like YouTube and you can also avail some premium upgrades on the platform of Vimeo’s Pro and Plus. If we talk about Vimeo tool specifically then users from marketing field may often find troubles regarding its very restricted work platform that is not suitable for commercial needs with its free version. The article below includes details about all popular Video flavours that beginners as well as professionals will love to explore.

 Here's our [Full Review of Vimeo](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) .

## Datiled Comparison

#### 1\. Storage

 If we talk about storage space then Vimeo Basic account offers maximum upload of only 500MB/ per or in other words, you can access 25GB for one year. In case of Vimeo Plus account, 5GB space is available to users per week and for one year they can access maximum 250GB. If we move towards then Vimeo Pro account then users here will be able to get 20GB /week and huge storage space of 1TB for year.

#### 2\. Customization

 The Vimeo basic free version cannot assist users with video customization features but outro and video player can be customized in case of Vimeo Plus account. Further, Vimeo Pro account assist users in advanced personalization features like facility to add logos, create customized outro etc. It also offers third party support for players.

#### 3\. Pricacy and Stats

 The Basic account can be accessed for free but it still offers so many incredible features like no duration limit, no advertisements, Video password protection as well as basic video conversion features. Users can see how many people liked and viewed their videos on channel. If you want to access Vimeo Plus account then pay $59.95/year and $9.95/month; the feature set is improved with addition of priority support, unlimited channel, albums and groups. Plus account users can avail information about video embed and viewers details. As Vimeo Pro offers so many advanced features like VIO support and advanced stats data so the cost also goes high up to $199/year package for 1TB storage space and $399/year for 3TB space.

#### 4\. Support

 If you are using Vimeo basic account then you must expect to get answers for your queries within 3 business days. The Vimeo Plus account users can avail response from support team within 4 hours during business days. The best thing to know about highly advanced Vimeo pro account users is that users can get answers for their queries within one hour and it stays active 24 hours even on weekends.

## Conclusion

 There is no doubt to say that basic membership option is great option for beginners but in case if you are in search of priority support service, privacy control, huge storage space, player customization and few other advanced tools then Vimeo Plus and Vimeo Pro will be more suitable to you. Price range also matters so prefer to pick your software tool as per your budget and needs to have best results.
