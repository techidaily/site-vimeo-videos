Your existing videos are a source of immense engagement for your channel, especially when a new user sees any of your videos. You can add the URLs to your three Vimeo videos related to your current video or redirect users to watch the series (e.g., part 1, part 2, etc.). This way, you can promote your existing content to get more views and get fruitful results.

### 2\. Branding in your niche

A content creator must take on the branding opportunities. The end screen lets the Vimeo Creators add links to their third-party websites or promote any product.

## Part 3: How to Add An End Screen in Vimeo?

Once you’ve decided to add the end screen to Vimeo videos, here are the steps you can follow:

### Step 1: Log in to Vimeo

Go to the official Vimeo website and log in to your account by following the on-screen instructions.

### Step 2: Open Video Settings

After log-in, you’ll be redirected to the Videos page. From your existing videos, click on the video in which you want to add the end screen.

### Step 4: Choose End Screen Option

You can choose among the various option available in the end screen setting. You can add a custom image, more videos, CTA, and more. The things you need to fill varies based on the end screen type you choose, as we talked about before. Choose the best one suits your need.

### Step 5: Click add and save

Once that option is selected. Click on the ‘’Add’’ button to add a video or custom image per the selected option. Click ‘’save’’ to add the end screen.

## Part 4: How to Change the End Screen on Vimeo Video?

Rather than going on a black screen, you can add the end screen to your Vimeo videos, appearing after your embedded video. If you want to replace the end screen type or the content on the end screen, you can follow the steps below.

Go to the ‘’interaction tool’’ and then click on the ‘’end screen’’ option. You’ll find a ‘’pencil option’’ there. Upon clicking, select the option you would like to select, including video, custom image, CTA, or more. Click on save to save the changes.

**_Why is Vimeo End Screen not showing?_**

Mostly, it depends on the player. If the player is small than 300 px wide and 169 px in height, the end screen might not appear.

**_Why can’t I add the end screen to the Vimeo video?_**

If you want to add an end screen, you must be a Vimeo Plus, Pro, or Business user.
