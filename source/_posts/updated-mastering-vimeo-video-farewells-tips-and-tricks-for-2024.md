Go to the ‘’interaction tool’’ and then click on the ‘’end screen’’ option. You’ll find a ‘’pencil option’’ there. Upon clicking, select the option you would like to select, including video, custom image, CTA, or more. Click on save to save the changes.

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**_Why is Vimeo End Screen not showing?_**

Mostly, it depends on the player. If the player is small than 300 px wide and 169 px in height, the end screen might not appear.

If you want to add an end screen, you must be a Vimeo Plus, Pro, or Business user.
