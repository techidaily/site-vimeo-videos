* Promotion of a website
* Fundraising event support

Apart from these above-stated reasons, professionals have found that the end screens can do even more for you as a content creator. Here are some of the additional benefits of adding end screens to Vimeo Videos:

### 1\. Video Promotion

Your existing videos are a source of immense engagement for your channel, especially when a new user sees any of your videos. You can add the URLs to your three Vimeo videos related to your current video or redirect users to watch the series (e.g., part 1, part 2, etc.). This way, you can promote your existing content to get more views and get fruitful results.

### 2\. Branding in your niche

A content creator must take on the branding opportunities. The end screen lets the Vimeo Creators add links to their third-party websites or promote any product.

## Part 3: How to Add An End Screen in Vimeo?

Once you’ve decided to add the end screen to Vimeo videos, here are the steps you can follow:

### Step 1: Log in to Vimeo

Go to the official Vimeo website and log in to your account by following the on-screen instructions.

### Step 2: Open Video Settings

After log-in, you’ll be redirected to the Videos page. From your existing videos, click on the video in which you want to add the end screen.

Go to the ‘’interaction tool’’ and then click on the ‘’end screen’’ option. You’ll find a ‘’pencil option’’ there. Upon clicking, select the option you would like to select, including video, custom image, CTA, or more. Click on save to save the changes.
