Go to the ‘’interaction tool’’ and then click on the ‘’end screen’’ option. You’ll find a ‘’pencil option’’ there. Upon clicking, select the option you would like to select, including video, custom image, CTA, or more. Click on save to save the changes.

**_Why is Vimeo End Screen not showing?_**

Mostly, it depends on the player. If the player is small than 300 px wide and 169 px in height, the end screen might not appear.
