Now select the people you want to share the video with by hitting their profile pic. After each selection a blue tick is going to appear beside their name. The video link can also be accompanied by a message. After confirming that you aren’t a robot you need to hit the send button.

Now that you know all about sharing the Vimeo video you are all set to share your favourite videos with your friends and followers.
